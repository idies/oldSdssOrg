SCRIPTS, MAKEFILES, BUILDFILES

The scripts and build files used to maintain this site are being
reorganized. Some of the old files may have useful information in
them, and may still be obtained from CVS. I have tagged the last
version that included these files in CVS as lastWithDepricatedScripts.
The files deleted are:
	imgcopy.sh
	imglink.sh
	imgunlink.sh
	Makefile
	RSYNCTHIS
	scripts/stat.pl 

An ant based build process is under development. Currently, Sun's java
must be available to ant. It can be run by executing ant in the
product's root directory.

CONTENT LOCATION

The content of sdss.org resides in AFS space, which appears on the 
/afs/fnal.gov/files/expwww/sdss/html directory on fnalu.fnal.gov.

SYMBOLIC LINKS

The subdirectory structure reflects the organization of web site.
There is one special aspect of this file space.  There are no
"index.html" files; instead symbolic links with "index.html" name
point to actual files.  Consistently, the actual files are named the
same as the directory name (except at the top), e.g. publication.html
in the publication sub-dir associates to (via symlink) to
"index.html".  Reminder, web server uses index.html as default page to
show users.
