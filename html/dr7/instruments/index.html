<h1>Survey instruments</h1>

<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Technical Summary <a
href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0006396">(York et al 2000)</a>,
available in html both at <a href="technicalPaper/index.html">this site</a>
and <a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v120n3/200050/200050.html">that
of the AJ</a>,  is the essential reference for survey instrumentation; we
present only a brief overview with important parameters here. Further
documentation can be found in the <a
href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/PBOOK/welcome.htm">SDSS Project
Book</a>.</p>
<dl>
 <h2> <dt><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AJ....131.2332G">Telescope</a></dt></h2>
    <dd>The SDSS uses a dedicated 2.5 m f/5 modified Ritchey-Chretien
      altitude-azimuth telescope located at <a
      href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/">Apache Point Observatory</a>, in south
      east New Mexico (Latitude 32&deg; 46' 49.30" N, Longitude 105&deg; 49'
      13.50" W, Elevation 2788m). A 1.08 m secondary mirror and two corrector
      lenses result in a 3&deg; distortion-free field of view. </dd>
  <h2><dt><a href="./imager/index.html">Imaging Camera</a></dt></h2>
    <dd>The imaging camera collects photometric imaging data using an array
      of 30 SITe/Tektronix 2048 by 2048 pixel CCDs arranged in six columns of
      five CCDs each, aligned with the pixel columns of the CCDs themselves.
      SDSS <i>r</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>z</i>, and <i>g</i> filters cover
      the respective rows of the array, in that order. The survey operates
      the instrument in a drift scan mode: the camera slowly reads the CCDs
      as the data is being collected, while the telescope moves along great
      circles on the sky such that images of objects move along the columns
      of the CCDs at the same rate the CCDs are being read. As an image of an
      object moves along the column of the CCDs, a CCD in each row collects
      data on that object. Therefore, the camera produces five images of a
      given object, all from the same column of CCDs, one from each CCD in
      that column. It takes an object 54 seconds to move from the beginning
      of a CCD to the end, so the effective exposure time in each filter is
      54 seconds. Because there is some space between the rows of CCDs it
      takes an image 71.7 seconds to move from the beginning of one row to
      the next. Each row corresponds to a different filter, so each object
      has one image in each filter, taken at 71.7 second intervals.
      <p>An additional 24 CCDs placed before and after the photometric CCDs
      collect astrometric data. Neutral density filters cover these CCDs, and
      allow collection of data on bright reference stars without
      saturation.</p>
      <p>Because there is space between the columns of CCDs, two passes along
      a great circle are required to obtain a solid area. The second pass is
      offset from the first such that the area that fell between columns in
      the first pass is images in the center of the columns in the second
      pass.</p>
    </dd>
  <h2><dt><a href="./spectrographs/index.html">Spectrographs</a></dt></h2>
    <dd>The SDSS uses two spectrographs, each of which has a blue channel and
      a red channel separated by a dichroic filter. 640 fibers (320 fibers
      per spectrograph) feed light from the focal plane into the
      spectrographs. A total of four 2048 &times; 2048, SITe/Tektronix CCDs (one
      for each channel of each spectrograph) collect the spectra.</dd>
  <h2><dt>Photometric Telescope (PT)</dt></h2>
    <dd>A single SITe/Tektronix 2048 by 2048 pixel CCD mounted on a separate
      telescope with a 20" aperture provides the data necessary for
      photometric calibration. Two corrector lenses expand the field of view
      of this classical Cassegrain telescope to almost a full degree. The PT
      has an effective focal ratio of f/8.8. The attached camera has a pixel
      scale of  1.15 arcseconds/pixel, and a field of view 39.2 arcminutes on
      a side. The photometric telescope periodically observes fields
      containing <a
      href="../glossary/index.html#primary_standard">primary
      standards</a> throughout a night of observing, providing a photometric
      solution for the night. The remaining time is used to observe <a
      href="../glossary/index.html#secondary_patch">secondary
      patches</a>.</dd>
