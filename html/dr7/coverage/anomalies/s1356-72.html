 <h3>Here is a possible SQL for recovering these objects (to do both in the context dr7 and Runsdb ) : </h3> 
<p>  
<p>
Select
p.run,p.rerun,p.camcol,p.field,p.obj,p.ra,p.dec,g,mode,p.status,stripe,strip
<p>
From
Photoobjall p,field f,segment s
<p>
Where
<p>
Ra between  70 and 50 and
<p>
Dec between 10 and 20   and
<p>
G between 18  and 18.2  and

<p>
p.fieldid = f.fieldid and f.segmentid = s.segmentid
<p>
(and mode=1 for the context dr7)
<p>
<p>
<p>

<h3>With this, we can select the interesting data in Runsdb keeping the data  from Runsdb: </h3>
<p>
($11 == 1356 && $4 > 103 && $4 < 131) || ($11==72 && $4 > 321)

<p>
The South strip of Stripe 1356 from the runsdb consists of objects from run 6003.
<p>
The South strip of Stripe 72 from the runsdb consists of objects from run 4843.
<p>

<h3> A new Stripe </h3>
<p>
The stripe  205 appears in the runsdb whereas it didn't exist in dr7. Here is a picture showing this stripe : here all the datas come from runsdb.
