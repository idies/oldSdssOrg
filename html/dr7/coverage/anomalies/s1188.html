 <h3>Here is a possible SQL for recovering these objects (to do both in the Runsdb and dr7 contect) : </h3>
<p>
<p>
Select
p.run,p.rerun,p.camcol,p.field,p.obj,p.ra,p.dec,g,mode,p.status,stripe,strip
<p>
From
Photoobjall p,field f,segment s
<p>
Where
<p>
Ra between  352 and 340 and
<p>
Dec between 20 and 30   and
<p>
G between 18  and 18.2  and
<p>
p.fieldid = f.fieldid and f.segmentid = s.segmentid
<p>
(and mode=1 for the context dr7)
<p>
<p>
<p>

<h3>With this, we can select the interesting data in Runsdb keeping the datas : </h3>
<p>
( $11== 72 &&  $4 > 268 )

<p>
The South strip of Stripe 72 from the runsdb consists of objects from run 4836.
<p>
<h3> A new stripe : </h3>


<p>
Moreover, in the Runsdb database appears another stripe, the stripe 291. In the following picture, all the datas come from Runsdb.
