<h3>Stripe 26 Footprint Anomaly</h3>

There is a defect in the footprint along stripe 26 from

in Camcols 2 and 3 of the Northern Strip of Stripe 26 in DR7.

These objects may be recovered from the RunsDB (select RunsDB as your
context in the CasJobs query menu):

<p>
<h3> Here is a possible SQL for recovering these objects : </h3>
<p>
<p>
Select p.run,p.rerun,p.camcol,p.field,p.obj,p.ra,p.dec,g,mode,p.status,stripe,strip
<p>
From
Photoobjall p,field f,segment s
<p>
Where
Ra between 270 and 210 and
<p>
Dec between 5 and  35 and
<p>
G between 18 and 18.2  and
<p>
p.fieldid = f.fieldid and f.segmentid = s.segmentid
<p>                          
( and mode = 1 for dr7 )
<p>
<p>
<h3> With this, we can select the right data in Runsdb with : </h3>
<p>
<p>
$11 == 26 && ( $3 == 2 || $3 == 3) && $12 == 1
<p>
The North strip of Stripe 26 from the runsdb consists of objects from run 4002.
