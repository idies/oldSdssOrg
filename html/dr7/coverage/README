Making the coverage plots and getting the numbers for the front page:

Coverage plots: run

select ra,dec from photoprimary
where objid % 1131 = 22

select ra,dec from specobjall
where specobjid % 5 = 2
and ra != -9999 and dec != -9999

Conveniently done at casjobs. Save results as fits tables:
dr4photoprimary.fits and dr4spectro.fits

Plots are made by proc plotall in dp/etc/survey.tcl Edit that proc to
reflect the currrent DR.

Then start astrotools and do
source dp/etc/survey.tcl
plotall

Then use gimp or similar photoshopping program to crop images and
insert a white background around the sky ellipse.
 

Numbers:

select count(*) from frame

select count(*),dbo.fspecclassn(specclass) from specobjall
group by specclass

select count(*) from specobjall where specclass in (3,4) and z<2.3

select count(*) from specobjall where specclass in (3,4) and z>=2.3

select count(*) from photoprimary


select sum(stripearea) from field
