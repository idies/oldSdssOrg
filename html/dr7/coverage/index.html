<h1>Sky coverage</h1>

<p>The DR7 contains that part of the SDSS imaging and spectroscopy
taken through July 14, 2008. Here we give coverage plots and the
detailed <a href="#tables">coverage tables</a> from which they were
constructed, though excluding the supplemental imaging scans released
through <a href="../start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a>. Further below, we
outline the <a href="#future">future sky coverage of SDSS</a>.  The
survey terms are explained in the sections on <a
href="#imaging">imaging coverage</a> and <a
href="#spectro">spectroscopic coverage</a> below.</p>


<p>For data interfaces, see the <a href="../access/index.html">data
access</a> page.</p>

<p><h4> Anomalies in the DR7 Footprint</h4><p> Several stripes, when
examined in detail, have anomalies (or errors) in the definition of the
PRIMARY (mode = 1) footprint.  Usually objects which should be in the
primary footprint are missing.  The links
here provide a guide to the anomalies on a stripe-by-stripe basis, and
in most cases, show sample SQL query clauses in which may be executed
on the RunsDB database in order to recover objects uniquely 
within the full DR7 footprint.

<p>
<h4> Anomalies in the Astrometry </h4>
<p>
The quoted astrometric errors for SDSS are about 100 mas per coordinate or
better, on average, around the sky.   To check this, we have compared
the positions of objects between the SDSS catalog and the 2MASS catalog, 
adn between the SDSS and the USNO-NOMAD catalogs, and we find a few
positions within the SDSS footprint, especially some scans at high 
declination, where the errors are larger than the nominal values.
In the following link we provide are some information about these 
astrometry anomalies, and how to find them.  <p>

<h2>Additional Contents</h2>

<h3>Open and Globular Clusters</h3>

DR7 includes spectroscopy of stars in 12 open and globular clusters
to calibrate the measurements of stellar parameters in SEGUE (Lee
et al. 
2008<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AJ....136.2022L">a</a>,<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AJ....136.2050L">b</a>).  
Many of these clusters are sufficiently close that
the giant branches are brighter than the photometric saturation limit
of SDSS, so the targets for these plates were selected from the
literature.  Indeed, the spectrographs would saturate as well with our
standard 15-minute exposures, so these observations had individual
exposure times as short as one or two minutes. Without proper flux
calibrators or exposure of bright sky lines to set the zeropoint of
the wavelength scale, the spectrophotometry and wavelength calibration
of the spectra on these plates are often quite inferior to that of the
main survey, and these plates are available only in the DAS, not the
CAS.

<h3>Repeat scans of the Celestial Equator</h3>

The 2.5&ordm; stripe centered on the Celestial Equator (stripe 82) was
imaged multiple times throughout SDSS and SDSS-II.  Each 2.5&ordm;
wide stripe is observed by a pair of offset strips to cover the full
width. DR7 contains data from the individual runs, including those
taken under non-ideal conditions, and a deep coadd of a subset of the
equatorial runs.

<a name="tables"></a><h2>Coverage tables</h2>

<p>For reference, the coverage tables describe the sky coverage in
terms of survey coordinates. To translate the sky coverage into
celestial coordinates, please refer to the <a

<a name="imaging"></a><h2>Imaging coverage: stripes, runs, reruns</h2>

<p>The survey coverage is defined in <a
href="../glossary/index.html#survey_coords">survey
coordinates</a>, as described in the <a
href="../products/general/edr_html/node26.html#SECTION00032200000000000000">coordinates
section of the EDR paper</a>. For detailed astrometry please see the
following <a href="./runs_with_different_node.html">note about parts
of the survey which have a slightly different survey coordinate system
from the rest</a>.</p>

<a name="stripe"></a>
<h3><em>Stripes</em></h3>

<p>The imaging survey scans the sky along great circles, which are
circles of constant survey latitude <em>eta</em>. Scans are obtained
along <em>stripes</em> spaced 2.5&deg; in survey latitude. Each stripe
has an integer stripe number <em>n</em> such that the inclination of a
stripe with respect to the celestial equator is -25&deg; + 2.5&deg;
&times; <em>n</em>.  The boundaries of the region eventually to be
surveyed by the SDSS are defined in terms of survey longitude
<em>lambda</em> in <a
href="./atStripeDef.par">atStripeDef.par</a>.</p>

<a name="runs"></a>
<h3><em>Runs</em> cover <em>strips</em>, two <em>strips</em> cover a <em>stripe</em></h3>

<p>An imaging <em>run</em> designates a continuous scan of the imaging
telescope. The survey camera's focal plane has six
columns of CCDs, so that a single run consists of six <em>camera
columns (camcols)</em> (see the <a
href="../instruments/index.html">instrument descriptions</a>). The
camera columns have a gap which is filled by an offset second run.  The
six <em>camcols</em> taken together are called a <em>strip</em>. Thus
to completely cover the two <em>strips</em> making up one
<em>stripe</em>, at least two <em>runs</em> are required. The imaging
data reduction is done on a run-by-run basis, hence the imaging data in our <a
href="../data/index.html">Data Archive</a> are accessible by run
number.

<h3>Great circle coordinates</h3>

<p>Every stripe has its own <a
href="../glossary/index.html#great_circle_coords">great circle
coordinate system</a>. The coordinate along a great circle is called
<em><a href="../glossary/index.html#mu">mu</a></em>. The range of data
actually obtained for a given <em>stripe</em> is reported in terms of
a range in great circle <em>mu</em> along that <em>stripe</em> as
<span class=".eqn">startMu</span> and <span class=".eqn">endMu</span>
in the coverage tables above.  Both <span class=".eqn">startMu</span>
and <span class=".eqn">endMu</span> are given in integer
arcseconds.</p>

<p>The calibrated object lists are accessible in the archive by stripe
number and startMu on that stripe.</p>

<p>For historical reasons, DR1 contained both photometric and
spectroscopic data which lay outside the official survey limits, i.e.,
the <em>startMu/endMu</em> for some runs extend beyond the
<em>lambda</em> limits for the <em>stripes</em> they cover. Since DR3,
only the <code>target</code> data in those areas are still marked
non-primary, but the <code>best</code> data <em>are</em> primary. Please
refer to this <a href="./data_outside_survey.html">note about DR7 data
outside the SDSS survey area</a> for details on how to retrieve
these.</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>

<p>A <em>run</em> is divided into images 2048 pix &times; 1361 pix
which are called <em>fields</em>. Each field then has the first 128
rows of the following field attached to it, so that all survey images
actually have a size of 2048 pix &times; 1489 pix.</p>

<p>Object detection, photometry and classification are done field by
field.  In particular, the <a
href="../products/catalogs/index.html">calibrated object lists</a> and
survey <a href="../products/images/index.html">images</a> are
distributed separately for each field. To account for the overlap, object
detection is not performed on the first 64 rows or the last 64 rows of
each corrected frame.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that one therefore should use only objects in
the <a href="../glossary/index.html/#primary">"primary"</a> area of
each survey field, in order to avoid duplicate area and duplicate
object detections. Near the center of a stripe, the primary area will
be the full 2048 pix &times; 1361 pix, but frames overlap near the
ends of stripes, reducing the primary area there. Please refer to how
<a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html#status"> "primary" is set in
the "status" flag of an object</a> and please also see the details of
<a href="../algorithms/resolve.html"> how overlapping areas are
resolved</a>. The primary area of each field is recorded as entry
<code>stripeArea</code> in the <a
href="../dm/flatFiles/tsField.html">tsField*.fit</a> file</p>


<h3>Reruns</h3>

<p>Every time we (re)process our imaging data, we assign the outputs a
new <em>rerun</em> number. <strong>Thus, a rerun does not imply
re-observation, but is simply a re-reduction of the same run.</strong>
The re-reduction can use more recent software or calibrations than a
previous rerun, or both.  Across runs, the rerun is an arbitrary
index, so the same rerun of different runs does not have to be
produced with the same software or calibrations.</p>

<a name="targetbest"></a>
<h3><em>Target</em> and <em>Best</em></h3>

We publish two <em>reruns</em> for each <em>run</em>:
<ol>
  <li>A <em>target</em> rerun, which is the reduction used to select
      targets for the spectroscopic survey. This is referred to as
      <strong>skyVersion = 0</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>A <em>best</em> rerun, which is the best available
      reduction. This is usually a different rerun from the
      <em>target</em> version, since our photometric pipelines have
      been evolving. The <em>best</em> rerun is referred to as
      <strong>skyVersion = 1</strong>. All <em>best</em> reruns
      have <var>rerun &gt;=</var>40.</li>
</ol>

There is one coverage table each for the target and best version. The
tables contain the following information:
<ul>
  <li>The survey area on the sky, given as a <em>stripe number</em>
      and a range for the <em>mu</em> coordinate (<code>startmu</code>
      &lt;= <em>mu</em> &lt;= <code>endmu</code>).  These were used
      to create the plots above.</li>
  <li>The <em>runs</em> and <em>reruns</em> and the range of
      <em>fields</em> which cover the given area.  This is the
      information needed to find data for a given part of the sky in
      the <a href="../data/index.html">Data archive</a>.</li>
</ul>

Notes
<ul>
  <li>In general, the <em>target</em> and <em>best</em> version of a
particular region of the sky come from the same run. However, there
are some exceptions which are explained in the <a
href="./targetvbest.html">list of runs differing for target and
best</a>.</li>
  <li>If it seems that other data are missing from some run, look at
      the <a href="./camcoldiffs.html">list of fields which are meant
      to be missing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="spectro"></a><h2>Spectroscopy</h2>

The spectrograph's 640 fibers are distributed on a plug plate of
roughly 3&deg; diameter (7 square degree area) projected on
sky. Spectroscopic coverage is given in terms of the plate centers.
Plates are identified by a unique number assigned during targetting
and the MJD on which they were observed, to distinguish
re-observations of the same plate.
