<h1>The SDSS Data Release 7 Supplemental</h1>

<p>The original description of the original DRsup, along with that of
DR5 to which it originally referred, are described in the <a
href="./dr5.pdf">DR5 paper, Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2007, ApJ
Supplements, in press [pdf, 1 MB]</a>.</p>
      

<p>  Imaging Runs and Spectroscopic Plates which do not fall into
   a category such as "Legacy" "SEGUE" "Supernovae", have been
presented in previous SDSS data releases as part of a DRsup "Data Release
Supplemental" package.  With DR7, this supplemental data
are folded into the three CAS and one DAS databases.

The supplemental imaging is a list of special imaging scans,
not taken on Legacy or SEGUE survey <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/coverage/atStripeDef.par">stripes</a>.


<p>Here is the <a
  href="../coverage/tssup.html">list of special imaging
  runs available </a>.</p>

<p>While only a subset of these runs are searchable in the CAS SQL
databases, the remainder are available as part of a 
<a href="http://das.sdss.org">
DAS (Data Archive Server)</a>. This is a flat-file web-based file
server which allows retrieval via 'browser-tools' such as IE, Firefox
or command-line interfaces such as 'wget' or 'curl'.</p>
