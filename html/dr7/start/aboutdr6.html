<h3>New for DR6</h3>

<p>DR6 is the first release since DR2 to have significant changes to
the processing software. As it includes the first data from SDSS-II,
it also adds substantially different data products - see <a
href="./aboutsegue.html">About SEGUE</a> and <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/drsn1/DRSN1_data_release.html">the first
public data release from the SDSS Supernova Survey</a>. The
qualitatively new items are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SEGUE</strong> imaging catalogs and quality assurance (QA) are available in the <a
      href="http://cas.sdss.org/seguedr6/en/tools/search/sql.asp">SEGUE
      CAS database</a>. SEGUE targeting flags will eventually be available for
      all DR6 imaging, including legacy. See the <a
      href="../algorithms/target.html#SEGUE">target-selection
  algorithms page</a> for information on SEGUE targeting.<br />
      For SEGUE imaging runs, note the <a href="../products/catalogs/index.html#cav_lowlat">caveat on  low-latitude photometry</a> and
      reddening corrections!</li>
  <li><strong>Stellar spectroscopy</strong> Stellar <code>Spectral Parameters Pipeline</code> <a
      href="../products/spectra/spectroparameters.html">line
      measurements (<code>sppParams</code>, [Fe/H], log g, Teff)</a>
      and <a href="../products/spectra/spectrolineindices.html">line
      index measurements (<code>sppLines</code>Ca, Mg, etc.)</a> are
      available both in the CAS and the DAS for SEGUE and many SDSS
      spectra. <br /><strong>Important!</strong> The SEGUE spectra count as
      <a href="../products/spectra/special.html">special-plate</a> spectra
      in the CAS and are <strong>not</strong> considered to be
      &quot;scienceprimary&quot;. Therefore, they are <em>not</em> linked to the photometry in
      the usual way, e.g., they do not appear in the object
      browser's default view like galaxy, quasar and stellar spectra from
      the legacy survey. Moreover, all SEGUE spectra are in the
      <code>BESTDR6</code> database, while most of the SEGUE imaging is in
      the <code>SEGUEDR6</code> database of the CAS, so that linking
      imaging and spectroscopy data requires special care. See the <a
      href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/getstarted.html#ex4">SEGUE sample
      SQL query for instructions on joining SEGUE imaging and
      spectroscopy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Ubercal</strong> improved calibrations using cross-scans
      to tie the photometry of the entire survey to each other. See the <a
      href="../algorithms/fluxcal.html#ubercal">algorithms entry on ubercal</a></li>
  <li><strong>Improved spectroscopy reductions</strong> The
      <code>spec2d</code> code that reduces the spectrograph's
      2-dimensional CCD images into 1-dimensional spectra has been
      modified substantially. The most important changes are:
      <ol>
	<li>Improved spectrophotometry, now calibrated relative to PSF,
	    not fiber magnitudes. <strong>The
	    spectrophotometric flux scale is now brighter by 0.35 mag,
	    or 25%.</strong></li>
	<li>Availability of additional data products, including
	    individual 15-minute exposures (DAS only) and
	    sky spectra</li>
      </ol>
  </li>     
  <li>In the <code>spectro1d</code> pipeline analyzing the reduced
      1-dimensional spectra, the algorithm for velocity dispersions
      has been changed, see <a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133.1954B">Bernardi
      2007, <em>The sigma-L correlation in nearby early-type
      galaxies</em>, AJ, 133, 1954</a> and there are <a
      href="../products/spectra/radvelocity.html">improved
      radial-velocity estimates for stars</a></li>
  <li>In the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr6/en/">CAS
      database</a>, the following changes have occured:
      <ul>
	<li>All the columns from the <code>photoAuxAll</code>
	    table (galactic coordinates and astrometric errors in RA
	    and DEC) are now part of <strong>photoObjAll</strong> and derived views
	    (<code>photoObj</code>, <code>star</code>, <code>photoPrimary</code>
	    etc.).  For backwards compatibility, there are still 
	    <code>photoAuxAll</code> and <code>photoAux</code> views,
	    but new queries requiring these parameters do not need
	    these auxiliary tables any more.</li>
	<li>There have been changes in the sector/region code in the CAS</li>
	<li>A <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr6/en/help/browser/enum.asp?n=PhotoClean">&quot;clean photometry&quot; flag</a> has been added to
	    <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr6/en/help/browser/description.asp?n=PhotoObjAll&amp;t=U"><code>photoObjAll</code></a> table to facilitate
	    <a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">photometric flag
	    checking</a>.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The quantitatively new items are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased sky
      coverage of the <em>Legacy</em> survey in both imaging and
      spectroscopy (as with any data release).  The contiguous imaging in
      the north galactic cap is essentially complete now.</li>
  <li>Additional <a
      href="../products/value_added/">value-added
      catalogs</a> (e.g., the <a
      href="../products/value_added/qsocat_dr5.html">DR5
      quasar catalog</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p> Except for the changes in the spectroscopic pipeline
<code>spec2d</code> and the CAS changes described above, the pipelines
and databases are essentially identical in DR6, DR5, DR4, DR3 and DR2.
Thus, DR6 is (very nearly) a proper superset of DR5, which is a
superset of DR4, etc.  The DR2 included reprocessing of all data
included in DR1, and those data in EDR that pass our data-quality
criteria for the official survey.  For details about what changed in
subsequent releases, please refer to <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/DR4/start/aboutdr4.html">About DR4</a> and
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/DR5/start/aboutdr5.html">About
DR5</a>.</p>

<h2>What DR6 contains</h2>

<p>The DR6 imaging data cover about 8420 square degrees of
&quot;legacy&quot; sky, with information on roughly 230 million
distinct photometric objects, and about 1200 square degrees of SEGUE
sky, with about 57 million objects.  The DR6 spectroscopic data
include data from 1520 main survey plates of 640 spectra each, and
cover 6860 square degrees. In addition, DR6 contains 467
&quot;extra&quot; and &quot;special&quot; plates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>64 &quot;extra&quot; plate/MJD combinations which are repeat
      observations of 55 distinct main survey plates</li>
  <li>383 distinct &quot;special&quot; plates, which includes 162
      SEGUE plates (see above), and 226 plates with 
      observations of spectroscopic targets, mostly in the southern galactic cap, which
      were selected by the collaboration for a series of specialized science
      programs. Some of these plates are outside of the
      regular DR6 imaging area; <a href="./aboutdrsup.html">DR6sup</a> provides
      that missing imaging, among other things.</li>
  <li>15 &quot;extraspecial&quot; repeat observations of
      &quot;special&quot; plates (7 of SEGUE plates, and 8 of other
      special plates)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a separate page describing <a
href="../products/spectra/special.html">the special plates in
DR6</a> </p>

<p>The DR6 footprint is defined by all non-repeating survey-quality
imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the
Nothern Galactic Cap, and three stripes in the Southern Galactic Cap
obtained prior to 7 July 2006, and the spectroscopy associated with
that area as well as the <em>extra</em> and <em>special</em> plates
obtained before that date.  In fact, 34 square degrees of imaging data
in the Nothern Galactic Cap lie outside this ellipse.  While the DR6
scans do not repeat a given area of sky, they do overlap to some
extent, and the data in the overlaps are included in earlier releases
as well. The sky coverage of the imaging and spectroscopic data that
make up DR6 are given on the <a href="../coverage/index.html">coverage
page</a>.  The natural unit of imaging data is a run; the DR6 contains
data from (about) 244 runs in the best database, and (about) 246 runs
in the target database.</p>

<p>A total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target
and best, the majority along the Equatorial Stripe in the Fall sky.</p>

<p>We also make available images and associated catalogs from
three categories of special runs as a 
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr6/start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a> 
(supplemental) DAS-only data release.  They are: 
  <ul>
  <li>A series of repeat scans of the Equatorial Stripe in the Southern
      Galactic Cap (Stripe 82);</li>
  <li>Scans through M31 and the Perseus Cluster;</li>
  <li>Scans taken at low Galactic latitude as part of the SEGUE project;
      these runs were used to target stars on <a
      href=http://www.sdss.org/dr6/products/spectra/special.html>
      special plates</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Imaging caveats</h2>

<p>The following caveat is new to DR6.</p>

<h3>Systematic relative photometry errors in extreme-coloured
stars</h3>

<p>Stars with extreme colours can have inconsistent photometry due to
slight differences in the photometric response for different
camcols. There is a brief description in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007astro.ph..3157I">Ivezic et
al. 2007, AJ in press</a>.</p>

<p>The following caveat has been characterised quantitatively now:</p>

<h3>Overestimation of sky levels in the vicinity of bright
objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/catalogs/brightgalsky.html"-->

<p>The following caveats apply unchanged to DR6.</p>

<h3>Red leak to the <var>u</var> filter and very red objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_redleak.html"-->

<h3>Bias in sky determination</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_sky.html"-->

<h3>Zeropoint of the photometric system</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../algorithms/sdssab.html"-->

<h3>Holes in the imaging data</h3>

<p>About 0.3% of the DR6 imaging footprint area 
(about 25 square degrees) for DR6 are marked as
<em>holes</em>.  These are indicated in the CAS by setting
<code>quality=5 (HOLE)</code> in the <code>tsField</code> file and
<code>field</code> table and given in the <a
href="../coverage/holes.html">list of quality holes</a>, which
contains further details about the holes and quality flags, including
a information about a table in the CAS which allows
one to query for quality information about each field of data.</p>

<h3>Problems with one <var>u</var> chip</h3>

<p>The <var>u</var> chip in the third column of the camera is read out
on two amplifiers.  On occasion, electronic problems on this chip
caused one of the two amplifiers to fail, meaning that half the chip
has no detected objects on it.  This was a problem for only two of the
105 imaging runs included in DR5: run 2190, which includes a total of
360 frames in two separate contiguous pieces on strip 12N (centered
roughly at delta = +5 degrees in the North Galactic Cap; NGC), and run
2189, which includes 76 frames on stripe 36N near the northern
boundary of the contiguous area in the NGC.  The relevant frames are
flagged as bad in the <code>quality</code> flag; in addition,
individual objects in this region have the <var>u</var> band flagged
as <code>NOTCHECKED_CENTER</code> (or, for objects which straddle the
boundary between the two amplifiers, <code>LOCAL_EDGE</code>).  <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.2945R">Richards
et al (2002)</a> describe how the quasar selection algorithm handles
such data; the net effect is that no quasars are selected by the
<var>ugri</var> branch of the algorithm for these data.</p>

<a name="speccaveat"></a>
<h2>Spectroscopy caveats</h2>

<h3>Problematic plates (new: flux scale offset for 28 plates)</h3>

<p>A small number of plates suffered from a variety of minor problems
affecting the quality of the spectrophotometry (but not of
redshifts). See the list under <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#badplates">Plates with
problematic spectrophotometry</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<p>A problem new to DR6 is that 28 plate/MJD combinations have an
offset in their spectrophotometric flux scale. See <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotooffset">spectrophotometry
flux scale offset caveat</a>.

<h3>Zero equivalent width of emission lines, especially H alpha</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/zeroEW.html"-->

<h3>Note about galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/galextinction.html"-->


<h3>Mismatches between the spectroscopic and imaging data</h3>

<p>For various reasons, a small fraction of the spectroscopic objects
do not have a counterpart in the <code>best</code> object catalogs. In
addition, the DR6 does not contain photometric information for some of
the <a href="../products/spectra/special.html">special plates</a>, and
the retrieval of photometric data from the CAS database requires
special care for objects from the special plates, and even more care
for SEGUE spectra.  See the caveat
about <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotomismatch">mismatches
between spectra and images</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>
