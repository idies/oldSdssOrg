<h3>New for DR7.1</h3>


<ul>
  <li>DR7.1 contains 205 new plates worth of spectra (136 Legacy, 65 SEGUE, 4 Baotest plates)</li>
  <li>DR7.1 contains over 1200 square degrees of new SEGUE low-latitude
     imaging </li>

  <li>DR7.1 CAS contains an all new 'propermotions' table for over 100M
	objects, with corrected and updated values</li>
  <li>DR7.1 CAS contains an all new sppParams table with updated
		velocities and estimates of [Fe/H], log g Teff and
	stellar type classification info for over 330,000 stellar spectra</li>
</ul>


<p> Except for the addition of new data and the changes in the 
sspp pipeline and the propermotions code described above, the pipelines 
and databases are essentially identical in 
DR7.1, DR6, DR5, DR4, DR3 and DR2.  Thus, DR7.1 is a proper 
superset of DR6, which is a
superset of DR5, etc.  The DR2 included reprocessing of all data
included in DR1, and those data in EDR that pass our data-quality
criteria for the official survey.  For details about what changed in
subsequent releases, please refer to 
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/DR6/start/aboutdr6.html">About DR6</a>.</p>

<h2>What DR7 contains</h2>

<p>The DR7 imaging data cover about 8420 square degrees of
&quot;legacy&quot; sky, with information on roughly 230 million
distinct photometric objects, and about  2400 (up from 1200) square degrees of SEGUE
sky, with about 110 million objects.  The DR7.1 spectroscopic data
include data from 1656 main survey plates of 640 spectra each, and
cover 7470 square degrees. In addition, DR7.1 contains 536
&quot;extra&quot; and &quot;special&quot; plates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>64 &quot;extra&quot; plate/MJD combinations which are repeat
      observations of 55 distinct main survey plates</li>
  <li>452 distinct &quot;special&quot; plates, which includes 227
      SEGUE plates (see above), and 230 plates with 
      observations of spectroscopic targets, mostly in the southern galactic cap, which
      were selected by the collaboration for a series of specialized science
      programs. Some of these plates are outside of the
      regular DR7.1 imaging area; <a href="./aboutdrsup.html">DR71sup</a> provides
      that missing imaging, among other things.</li>
  <li>15 &quot;extraspecial&quot; repeat observations of
      &quot;special&quot; plates (7 of SEGUE plates, and 8 of other
      special plates)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a separate page describing <a
href="../products/spectra/special.html">the special plates in
DR7.1</a> </p>

<p>The DR7.1 footprint is defined by all non-repeating survey-quality
imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the
Nothern Galactic Cap, and three stripes in the Southern Galactic Cap
obtained prior to 14 July 2007, and the spectroscopy associated with
that area as well as the <em>extra</em> and <em>special</em> plates
obtained before that date.  
In fact, 34 square degrees of imaging data
in the Nothern Galactic Cap lie outside this ellipse.  
Additional a small number of SEGUE imaging runs obtained between July and 
November 2007 are also included. 
While the DR7.1 scans do not repeat a given area of sky, they do 
overlap to some extent, and the data in the overlaps are included in 
earlier releases as well. The sky coverage of the imaging and 
spectroscopic data that
make up DR7.1 are given on the <a href="../coverage/index.html">coverage
page</a>.  The natural unit of imaging data is a run; the DR7.1 contains
data from 265 runs in the best database,  267 runs
in the target database, and 85 runs in the SEGUE database.</p>

<p>A total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target
and best, the majority along the Equatorial Stripe in the Fall sky.</p>

<p>We also make available images and associated catalogs from
three categories of special runs as a 
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7.1/start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a> 
(supplemental) DAS-only data release.  They are: 
  <ul>
  <li>A series of repeat scans of the Equatorial Stripe in the Southern
      Galactic Cap (Stripe 82);</li>
  <li>Scans through M31 and the Perseus Cluster;</li>
  <li>Scans taken at low Galactic latitude as part of the SEGUE project;
      these runs were used to target stars on <a
      href=http://www.sdss.org/dr6/products/spectra/special.html>
      special plates</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Imaging caveats</h2>

<p>The following caveat is new to DR7.1</p>

<p>The following caveats apply unchanged to DR7.1</p>

<h3>Red leak to the <var>u</var> filter and very red objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_redleak.html"-->

<h3>Bias in sky determination</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_sky.html"-->

<h3>Zeropoint of the photometric system</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../algorithms/sdssab.html"-->

<h3>Holes in the imaging data</h3>

<p>About 0.3% of the DR7.1 imaging footprint area 
(about 25 square degrees) for DR7.1 are marked as
<em>holes</em>.  These are indicated in the CAS by setting
<code>quality=5 (HOLE)</code> in the <code>tsField</code> file and
<code>field</code> table and given in the <a
href="../coverage/holes.html">list of quality holes</a>, which
contains further details about the holes and quality flags, including
a information about a table in the CAS which allows
one to query for quality information about each field of data.</p>

<h3>Problems with one <var>u</var> chip</h3>

<p>The <var>u</var> chip in the third column of the camera is read out
on two amplifiers.  On occasion, electronic problems on this chip
caused one of the two amplifiers to fail, meaning that half the chip
has no detected objects on it.  This was a problem for only two of the
105 imaging runs included in DR5: run 2190, which includes a total of
360 frames in two separate contiguous pieces on strip 12N (centered
roughly at delta = +5 degrees in the North Galactic Cap; NGC), and run
2189, which includes 76 frames on stripe 36N near the northern
boundary of the contiguous area in the NGC.  The relevant frames are
flagged as bad in the <code>quality</code> flag; in addition,
individual objects in this region have the <var>u</var> band flagged
as <code>NOTCHECKED_CENTER</code> (or, for objects which straddle the
boundary between the two amplifiers, <code>LOCAL_EDGE</code>).  <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.2945R">Richards
et al (2002)</a> describe how the quasar selection algorithm handles
such data; the net effect is that no quasars are selected by the
<var>ugri</var> branch of the algorithm for these data.</p>

<a name="speccaveat"></a>
<h2>Spectroscopy caveats</h2>

<h3>Problematic plates (new: flux scale offset for 28 plates)</h3>

<p>A small number of plates suffered from a variety of minor problems
affecting the quality of the spectrophotometry (but not of
redshifts). See the list under <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#badplates">Plates with
problematic spectrophotometry</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<p>A problem repeated from DR6 into DR7.1 is that 
28 plate/MJD combinations have an
offset in their spectrophotometric flux scale. See <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotooffset">spectrophotometry
flux scale offset caveat</a>.

<h3>Zero equivalent width of emission lines, especially H alpha</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/zeroEW.html"-->

<h3>Note about galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/galextinction.html"-->


<h3>Mismatches between the spectroscopic and imaging data</h3>

<p>For various reasons, a small fraction of the spectroscopic objects
do not have a counterpart in the <code>best</code> object catalogs. In
addition, the DR7.1 does not contain photometric information for some of
the <a href="../products/spectra/special.html">special plates</a>, and
the retrieval of photometric data from the CAS database requires
special care for objects from the special plates, and even more care
for SEGUE spectra.  See the caveat
about <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotomismatch">mismatches
between spectra and images</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>
