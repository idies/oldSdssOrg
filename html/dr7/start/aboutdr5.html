<h2>What DR5 contains</h2>

<p>The DR5 imaging data cover about 8000 square degrees, and include
information on roughly 215 million objects.  The DR5 spectroscopic
data include data from 1278 main survey plates of 640 spectra each,
and cover 5600 square degrees. In addition, DR5 
contains 361 &quot;extra&quot; and &quot;special&quot; plates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>62 &quot;extra&quot; plate/MJD combinations which are repeat
      observations of 53 distinct main survey plates,</li>
  <li>289 distinct &quot;special&quot; plates, which are observations
      of spectroscopic targets, mostly in the southern galactic cap, which
      were selected by the collaboration for a series of specialized science
      programs (note that some of these plates are outside of the DR5
      imaging area),</li>
  <li>and 10 &quot;extraspecial&quot; repeat observations of
      &quot;special&quot; plates.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a separate page describing <a
href="../products/spectra/special.html">the special plates in
DR5</a> </p>

<p>The DR5 footprint is defined by all non-repeating survey-quality
imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the
Nothern Galactic Cap, and three stripes in the Southern Galactic Cap
obtained prior to 1 July 2005, and the spectroscopy associated with
that area as well as the <em>extra</em> and <em>special</em> plates
obtained before that date.  In fact, 34 square degrees of imaging data
in the Nothern Galactic Cap lie outside this ellipse.  While the DR5
scans do not repeat a given area of sky, they do overlap to some
extent, and the data in the overlaps are included in earlier releases
as well. The sky coverage of the imaging and spectroscopic data that
make up DR5 are given on the <a href="../coverage/index.html">coverage
page</a>.  The natural unit of imaging data is a run; the DR5 contains
data from (about) 240 runs in the best database, and (about) 242 runs
in the target database.</p>

<p>A total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target
and best, the majority along the Equatorial Stripe in the Fall sky.</p>

<p>We also make available images and associated catalogs from
three categories of special runs as a 
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr5/start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a> 
(supplemental) DAS-only data release.  They are: 
  <ul>
  <li>A series of repeat scans of the Equatorial Stripe in the Southern
     Galactic Cap (Stripe 82);</li>
  <li>Scans through M31 and the Perseus Cluster;</li>
  <li>Scans taken at low Galactic latitude as part of the SEGUE project;
    these runs were used to target stars on <a
    href=http://www.sdss.org/dr5/products/spectra/special.html>
    special plates</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Except for the sky coverage, the pipelines and databases are
identical in DR5, DR4, DR3 and DR2.  Thus, DR5 is (very nearly) a proper
superset of DR4, which is a superset of DR3, which is a superset of DR2.  
The DR2 included reprocessing of all data included in DR1, and 
those data in EDR that pass our data-quality criteria for 
the official survey.  For details
about what changed from DR3 to DR4, please refer to <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/DR4/start/aboutdr4.html">About DR4</a> on
the DR4 web site.</p>

<p>There is a table <code>photoAuxAll</code> in the <a
href="../access/index.html#CAS">CAS</a> that contains errors and
covariances for the right ascension and declination as well as
galactic coordinates for all objects.  See the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/browser/description.asp?n=PhotoAuxAll&t=U">CAS
Schema Browser entry for photoAuxAll</a> and the <a
href="../algorithms/astrometry.html#errors">astrometry algorithms
description for the calculation of RA, DEC errors</a>.</p>

<h3>New for DR5</h3>

<!-- M31/southern scans sentence -->

<ul> <li><strong>Photometric redshifts for galaxies</strong> The DR1
    <a href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> had
    a table with photometric redshifts for galaxies, including
    galaxies fainter than those in the spectroscopic survey. The
    redshifts have now been computed and loaded into the database for
    DR5; there are now two different tables of photometric redshifts
    provided by two different groups within SDSS.  See the <a
    href="http://skyserver2.fnal.gov/test/en/help/docs/algorithm.asp?key=photoz">Skyserver
    documentation of the photometric redshift tables photz and
    photoz2</a>.  <li><strong>Coverage masks</strong> Detailed
    coverage masks which allow large-scale structure resarchers to
    easily calculate power spectrum and related quantities, and which
    allow the computation of the area covered by statistical samples
    such as the quasar sample are now in the DR5 CAS. See the <a
    href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/realquery.asp#qcomplete">CAS
    sample queries on generating a uniform quasar sample</a>.</li>
    <li>The <strong>runQA</strong> bug of using only the <var>s</var>
    color in the determination of a run's summary quality is now fixed
    and the proper colors are used in all quality determinations.  In
    addition, runQA is now also available for the <em>target</em> 
    photometry in a new CAS table <code>targRunQA</code>, in addition
    to the <em>best</em>-era information in the <code>runQA</code> table.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Not entirely new, but still noteworthy</h3>

<h4>Stetson and RC3 catalogs are in CAS</h4>

<p>There are two tables <code>stetson</code> and <code>RC3</code> in
the holding photometric catalogs. <code>stetson</code> includes
stellar B, V, R, and I Kron-Cousins photometry with an accuracy of
0.02 mag or better from <a
href="http://cdsaas.u-strasbg.fr:2001/cgi-bin/link_ADS?2000PASP..112..925S">Stetson
(2000)</a>, as downloaded from the <a
href="http://cadcwww.dao.nrc.ca/standards">Canadian Astronomy Data
Centre photometric standards Web site</a>. <code>RC3</code> contains
data from the <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1991trcb.book.....D&amp;db_key=AST">Third
Reference Catalog of Galaxies (de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991)</a>. Both
are included in the CAS to allow cross-reference to SDSS data.</p>

<h4>Photometric transformations between SDSS and Kron-Cousins systems</h4>

<p>There is a long page describing <a
href="../algorithms/sdssUBVRITransform.html">transformations between
SDSS (ugriz) and Kron-Cousins (UBVR<sub>c</sub>I<sub>c</sub>) photometry</a>.</p>

<h2>Imaging caveats</h2>

<p>The following caveats apply unchanged to DR5.</p>

<h3>Overestimation of sky levels in the vicinity of bright
objects</h3>

<p>A study of weak lensing in the SDSS imaging data <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005astro.ph..1201M">(Mandelbaum
et al.  2005)</a> found a systematic, 5% decrease in the number
density of faint objects within 90&prime;&prime; of bright
(<var>r</var> &lt; 18) galaxies.  This was found to be due to a
systematic overestimation of the sky levels in the vicinity of bright
objects, which of course will affect all the measured photometric
quantities of faint objects, including the classification as stars and
galaxies.  The brighter the object, the larger the overestimation of
sky; indeed, restricting to foreground galaxies brighter than
<var>r</var> = 16, the number density of fainter galaxies is 10% below
the mean.  The effect is due to the way in which the sky levels are
estimated in the SDSS; they can be biased upward by the faint outer
isophotes of a bright galaxy (see the <a
href="../algorithms/edrpaper.html">EDR paper</a> [<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123..485S">Stoughton
et al. 2002</a>]; see also the discussion in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....124.1810S">Strauss
et al. 2002</a>).  Closer than 40&prime;&prime; to the bright objects,
the intrinsic clustering of galaxies makes it difficult to assess the
problem.  This problem is most relevant for applications that involve
correlating positions of bright objects with faint ones, yielding a
spurious anti-correlation on the affected scales.  We are currently
investigating changes to the imaging pipeline to address this problem.</p>


<h3>Red leak to the <var>u</var> filter and very red objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_redleak.html"-->

<h3>Bias in sky determination</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_sky.html"-->

<h3>Zeropoint of the photometric system</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../algorithms/sdssab.html"-->

<h3>Holes in the imaging data</h3>

<p>About 0.3% of the DR5 imaging footprint area 
(about 10/square degree) for DR5 are marked as
<em>holes</em>.  These are indicated in the CAS by setting
<code>quality=5 (HOLE)</code> in the <code>tsField</code> file and
<code>field</code> table and given in the <a
href="../coverage/holes.html">list of quality holes</a>, which
contains further details about the holes and quality flags, including
a information about a table in the CAS which allows
one to query for quality information about each field of data.</p>

<h3>Problems with one <var>u</var> chip</h3>

<p>The <var>u</var> chip in the third column of the camera is read out
on two amplifiers.  On occasion, electronic problems on this chip
caused one of the two amplifiers to fail, meaning that half the chip
has no detected objects on it.  This was a problem for only two of the
105 imaging runs included in DR5: run 2190, which includes a total of
360 frames in two separate contiguous pieces on strip 12N (centered
roughly at delta = +5 degrees in the North Galactic Cap; NGC), and run
2189, which includes 76 frames on stripe 36N near the northern
boundary of the contiguous area in the NGC.  The relevant frames are
flagged as bad in the <code>quality</code> flag; in addition,
individual objects in this region have the <var>u</var> band flagged
as <code>NOTCHECKED_CENTER</code> (or, for objects which straddle the
boundary between the two amplifiers, <code>LOCAL_EDGE</code>).  <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.2945R">Richards
et al (2002)</a> describe how the quasar selection algorithm handles
such data; the net effect is that no quasars are selected by the
<var>ugri</var> branch of the algorithm for these data.</p>

<a name="speccaveat"></a>
<h2>Spectroscopy caveats</h2>

<h3>Zero equivalent width of emission lines, especially H alpha</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/zeroEW.html"-->

<h3>Main survey spectra which are not marked <code>sciencePrimary =
1</code> in CAS</h3>

<p>Due to a bug in the pipelines, there are no <a
href="../dm/flatFiles/tsTargets.html">tsTargets*.fits</a> files for
plates 1617-1620, 1623, and 1652. As a consequence, the objects from
these plates do not have entries in the <code>target</code> and
<code>targetInfo</code> tables in the CAS.  Hence they are not marked
<code>sciencePrimary = 1</code> and do not appear in the default
<code>specObj</code> and <code>specPhoto</code> views, which provide a
filtered set of unique science spectra and form the basis of all
query interfaces. Use the <code>specObjAll</code> and and
<code>specPhotoAll</code> tables to access spectra from these plates
in the CAS.</p>

<h3>Note about galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/galextinction.html"-->


<h3>Problematic plates</h3>

<p>A small number of plates suffered from a variety of minor problems
affecting the quality of the spectrophotometry (but not of
redshifts). See the list under <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#badplates">Plates with
problematic spectrophotometry</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<h3>Mismatches between the spectroscopic and imaging data</h3>

<p>For various reasons, a small fraction of the spectroscopic objects
do not have a counterpart in the <code>best</code> object catalogs. In
addition, the DR5 does not contain photometric information for some of
the <a href="../products/spectra/special.html">special plates</a>, and
the retrieval of photometric data from the CAS database requires
special care for objects from the special plates.  See the caveat
about <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotmismatch">mismatches
between spectra and images</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<h2>Advanced features not yet available in DR5</h2>

<p>There are a number of advanced features or data products that are
not yet available in DR5, but will be in the near future.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IQS/SQS</strong> The <a
      href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/IQS.asp">Imaging
Query Server (IQS)</a> and <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro
      Query Server (SQS)</a> form interfaces have been re-enginered to
      use a faster database.  They currently do not provide a direct
      link to the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR5-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS data
      download form</a>; users need to save .csv files with the
      necessary information and upload these by hand to the DAS form.</li>
