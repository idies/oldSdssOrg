<h1>The u'g'r'i'z' Standard Star System -- USNO40 Response Function</h1>

<HR>

<H3>USNO40 Filter Transmission Curves</H3> 

The u'g'r'i'z' filters used on the USNO 40-in telescope at Flagstaff Station, Arizona,
were manufactured by Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd. in Japan according to the specifications 
given at <A HREF="http://indus.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/works/SDSS/filters/filter_spec"> 
this URL</A>.  

<P>

Here, we present the tabulated transmission curves for each filter, which were measured
in 1995 by the 
<A HREF="http://indus.astron.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/works/SDSS/">SDSS Japan Participation Group (JPG)</A>:

<H3>USNO40 CCD+u'g'r'i'z' Response Functions</H3>

These files were created by Jim Gunn and are response functions for
the USNO 40-inch/SITe 1024^2 UV-coated CCD + u'g'r'i'z' filters as
best as is understood at this point (011218).  The z' functions are
quite uncertain, as we have no measurements of the USNO CCD at all;
though the response through the visible and even into the uv is quite
constant from device to device, the far IR response is quite variable.
The QEs have been corrected for IR scattering and are the appropriate
responses for point sources, NOT extended objects. These corrections
are probably as uncertain as the underlying response is.

<P>
For more details, consult this <A HREF="./readme.txt"> README</A> file.

As better measurements of the USNO40 response functions are
determined, they will be placed on this website.

<H3>USNO40 CCD QE Response Function</H3>


The QE response for the USNO 40-inch CCD alone has never been
measured.  The USNO40 CCD is a thinned SITe UV-AR coated CCD, however,
and a representative example of a thinned SITe UV-AR coated CCD QE
response function is tabulated at <a href="./ccd_qe.txt"> this
URL</a>.
