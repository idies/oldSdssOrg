<h1>Changes from EDR to DR1</h1>

<p>The SDSS data, both imaging and spectroscopy, are processed through
an extensive series of software pipelines, which have been developed
over a number of years.  The versions of the software used for the
Early Data Release (EDR) met most (although not quite all) of our
scientific requirements.  This software and its performance is
described in detail in
<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123..485S&db_key=AST&high=3c76c4134306290"
target="_parent"> 
Stoughton et al (2002)</a> (hereafter, EDR paper), 
where a number of known problems and caveats are laid out.  Since that
time, there have been substantial revisions to all the pipelines
which have been used to process the DR1 data; this document describes
the most important of these changes and the effect that these have on
the science outputs of the survey.  Remaining known problems are
described as well. A summary description of DR1 is given in the <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AJ....126.2081A">DR1 paper</a>
(Abazajian et al 2003).</p>

<h2>		Photometric Calibration </h2>

<p>As described in the EDR paper (sections 3.2.1 and 4.5), our
photometric calibration system is complicated by the fact that we
calibrate with a separate telescope (the 20-inch 'Photometric
Telescope', or PT) from the one with which the imaging data are taken
(i.e., the 2.5m).  Because of unfortunate properties of the filters
used in these observations, the effective band-passes on the PT and
the 2.5m differ systematically.  Our previous formalism for carrying
out the photometric calibration took this into account in an
approximate, and not completely self-consistent way.  We have now
reformulated the photometric equations, so that we work directly in
the natural system of the 2.5m, making the relation between detected
counts and magnitude a simple one. The exact details are described in
this <a href="./sdssphot.ps">definition of the SDSS photometric system
(.ps, 80 kb)</a>.  (See also <a href=./jeg_photometric_eq_dr1.html>
this webpage</a> for a summary of the photometric equations now in
use.)</p>

<p>One consequence of making the photometry self-consistent is that we
no longer have to indicate our photometry as preliminary with the
asterisk notation.  Thus photometry as measured by the 2.5m, and as
released as part of DR1, should be referred to as <var>u g r i z</var>
(and not <var>u* g* r* i* z*</var>).  Note that the mean colors of
stars on the old and new systems (i.e., <var>u*g*r*i*z*</var>
vs. <var>ugriz</var>) have been forced to be the same.</p>

<h3>Conversion to AB magnitudes is difficult</h3>

<p>As Section 4.5 of the EDR paper discusses, putting these magnitudes
on a consistent AB system (i.e. converting the magnitude zeropoint
into physical flux units) is tricky.  We expect that our <var>u g r i
z</var> photometry is not exactly on the AB system, but we estimate
from several lines of argument that the <var>g-r</var>,
<var>r-i</var>, and <var>i-z</var> colors are nearly AB to within
about 3%.  We estimate that the u-g color is too red by about 5%
(again with about 3% of uncertainty), in the sense that
<var>(u-g)</var>(AB) = <var>(u-g)</var>(SDSS) - 0.05.  We are
continuing to work on measuring and cross-checking the exact
photometric AB zeropoints.

Note that our <i>relative</i> photometry is quite a bit better than
these numbers would imply; repeat observations show that our
calibrations are better than 2%.

<h2>	     The Photometric Pipeline</h2>

<p>This is the code that flat-fields and bias subtracts the images,
corrects for cosmic rays and bad columns, and finds and measures the
properties of objects.  As described in Section 4.5.4 of the EDR
paper, the flat fields are affected by scattered light, especially in
the u-band, thus giving systematically incorrect photometry.  We have
now characterized the flat fields much more accurately, and reduced
this systematic effect to be no larger than 2% in g, r, i and z, and
3% in u.  RMS statistics are substantially better; uncertainties in
the flat fields contribute less than 1% rms to the photometric error
in u, and less than 1/2% in all other bands.  </p>

<h3>Improved PSF fitting means improved photometric calibration</h3>

<p>Much of the photometric calibration depends on a detailed
understanding of the Point Spread Function (PSF); both its width as a
function of position and time, and its outer extent in order to carry
out an aperture correction (EDR paper Section 4.4.5.2).  The old
version of the pipelines had trouble following these variations when
the PSF was changing rapidly; this code has been made substantially
more robust now, and should remove residual effects in the photometry
as a function of seeing.   It is still true that there are small
regions of the data in which the seeing variations are so rapid (FWHM
changing by more than 0.2 arcsec in a minute) that the current code
will have systematic errors, but these errors are estimated and
propagated through to the quoted errors in the PSF photometry. 
</p>

<h3>Non-linearity correction applied</h3>

<p> There is a small but measureable non-linearity in the response of
the photometric CCD's, measuring several percent at saturation.  This
is now corrected for explicitly.  This is important, as the
photometric calibration is tied down at the bright end, where this
non-linearity can matter.  See the <a
href="../instruments/imager/nonlinearity.html">non-linearity
documentation</a> for details.</p>

<h3>Improved cosmic-ray rejection</h3>

<p> Cosmic rays are recognized as such by their sharp gradients
relative to the PSF.  This is effective in removing the vast majority
of them but, as described in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001AJ....122.2833F">Fan
et al (2001)</a>, is not perfect, especially when looking for rare
objects detected in only one band.  That paper describes an enhanced
routine to look for signs that a given detection might be a cosmic ray
masking as an object; this routine is now run as part of PHOTO.  A
flag, OBJECT2_MAYBE_CR, is set for objects which are suspected to be
cosmic rays.</p>

<a name="deblender"></a><h3>Deblender improvements</h3>

<p> The deblender (EDR Paper 4.4.3) separates overlapping images of
galaxies and stars.  It had the unfortunate behavior of often
shredding large galaxies with substructure into several pieces,
especially brighter than r ~15 mag.  This behavior has been
suppressed, and the vast majority of bright galaxies are now treated
properly by the deblender.
  The deblender works by noticing peaks in the image and assigning to
each a template shape from which to carry out the deblending.  If two
templates were substantially the same (i.e., if they were close to
degenerate), the deblender tended to give unphysical results.  This
was fixed by removing from the list of templates those that were close
to degenerate.  The photo flag <code>OBJECT2_DEBLEND_DEGENERATE</code>
is set to indicate parents for which this template pruning has
happened.  A related useful flag is
<code>OBJECT2_BRIGHTEST_GALAXY_CHILD</code>, which is set for that
child in a complicated deblend that is probably associated with the
bright galaxy in question (as the name implies). See the <a
href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">deblending flags
information</a>.</p>

<h3>Adaptive moments added</h3>

<p> In addition to the object shape measures described in Section
4.4.6 of the EDR paper, the photometric pipeline now calculates
so-called adaptive moments which weight the photons in a
close-to-optimal way for weak lensing measurements of faint objects.
These are described in detail in the <a
href="./adaptive.html">Adaptive Moments algorithm page</a>.  Briefly,
the quantities calculated include: <blockquote> M_e1 = (Mxx -
Myy)/(Mxx + Myy)<br> M_e2 = 2 Mxy/(Mxx + Myy)<br> M_rr_cc = Mxx +
Myy<br> </blockquote></p>

<p>Four items of the covariance matrix are stored.  Each term as listed
is the square root of the corresponding entry in the covariance
matrix; for negative covariance terms, the quantity 
sign(x)*abs(sqrt(x)) is stored.  The terms are:
<blockquote>
M_e1e1Err: The square root of the e1 variance<br>
M_e2e2Err: The square root of the e2 variance<br>
M_e1e2Err: The square root of the e1-e2 covariance (with the sign convention above)<br>
M_rr_ccErr: The square root of the rr-rr covariance<br>
</blockquote>
Also calculated is the fourth moment, M_cr4.  These moments are
*uncorrected* for the local PSF, so information on the shape of the
PSF is also output:
<blockquote>
M_e1_psf<br>
M_e2_psf <br>
M_rr_cc_psf<br>
M_cr4_psf<br>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Various flags are set indicating possible problems in determining
these moments.  A complete description of the PHOTO flags is given in
<a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">the description of photo
flags </a> (see the <a
href="../products/catalogs/flags.html#mmoment">description of
moment-related flags</a>).</p>

<h3>Improved model fits for large galaxies</h3>

<p>In previous versions of PHOTO (including that used for the EDR), the
exponential and de Vaucouleurs models were fit only to the central
4.4'' radius of each object. This was fine for distant, faint
galaxies, but tended to give misleading results for nearby galaxies
with large angular extent. The present code now does a much more
reasonable fit to large galaxies, meaning that, for example, model
magnitudes of bright galaxies are meaningful (but see below).  A small
bug in the pipeline caused the model fluxes of a handful of bright
galaxies to be estimated as negative; this is a rare occurrence, and
roughly half the DR1 data have been reduced with a version of the
pipeline that fixes this problem.</p>

<h3>Model log-likelihoods reported to avoid numerical underflow</h3>

<p>These model fits yield a formal likelihood.  In previous versions
of PHOTO, these had a tendency to underflow to zero, especially for
bright objects of high S/N.  The current pipeline now outputs the
natural log of the likelihood as well, to enable these quantities to
be useful.  </p>

<h3>The "model magnitude bug" and DR1 beta</h3>

<p> However, fixing one problem often reveals more subtle, hidden
problems.  Comparing the model (i.e., exponential and de Vaucouleurs
fits) and Petrosian magnitudes of bright galaxies shows a systematic
offset of about 0.2 magnitudes (in the sense that the model magnitudes
are brighter).  This turns out to be due to a bug in the way the PSF
was convolved with the models (this bug affected the model magnitudes
even when they were fit only to the central 4.4" radius of each
object).  This caused problems for very small objects (i.e., close to
being unresolved).  The code forces model and PSF magnitudes of
unresolved objects to be the same in the mean by application of an
aperture correction, which then gets applied to all objects.  The net
result is that the model magnitudes are fine for unresolved objects,
but systematically offset for galaxies brighter than at least 20th
mag.</p>

<p>The bug has been found and fixed in the latest version of the
software, but unfortunately, too late for distribution in the DR1
"beta" edition of the Data Archive Server.  We have carried out
extensive tests with data run through both versions of the code. In
summary:</p>
<a name="dr1beta"></a>
<ul>
 <li>Colors derived from model magnitudes are almost completely
insensitive to the bug.  Model magnitudes remain the optimal
quantities to use for the colors of extended objects, especially at
the faint end. </li>

 <li>For photometry of unresolved sources, one should use PSF
 magnitudes. </li>

 <li>For photometry of resolved sources, one should use Petrosian
magnitudes, especially at the bright end. </li>

 <li>The scale sizes derived from the model fits are systematically
wrong.  For exponential fits, the effective radii are systematically
0.15" too large in the present code (almost independent of r_e
itself), while for the de Vaucouleurs fits, they are roughly 25% too
large (almost independent of r_e itself, for r_e > 2 arcsec).  These
correction factors depend on seeing to some level, of course.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DR1 model magnitudes are better than EDR model magnitudes</h3>

<p>Again, it is worth emphasizing that the model magnitudes in DR1 are
appreciably better than those used in the EDR.  We are reprocessing
all the DR1 data with a version of the photometric pipeline that
addresses this remaining bug, and will release the results to the
public in the final release of DR1 as soon as they are ready. Also see
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr1/start/aboutdr1.html">About DR1</a>.</p>


<h2> The Astrometric Pipeline</h2> <p>
  The astrometric pipeline has been improved in a number of ways,
including superior treatment of chromatic aberration.  That, together
with the incorporation of improved centroids from the photometric pipeline
and improved astrometric calibration catalogs, have
improved the astrometric solutions.  Where UCAC data are
available, the rms residuals per
coordinate in the astrometric solutions are typically of order 60 mas.
See
<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v125n3/202156/202156.html">Pier et al. (2003)</a>
(AJ, or <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0211375">astro-ph/0211375</a>)
for a complete description of
the astrometric pipeline, including differences in the astrometry between
EDR and DR1.
</p>

<h2> The Spectroscopic Pipelines </h2> <p>

<h3>Improved spectrophotometry</h3>

<p>The 2d spectroscopic pipeline (idlspec2d) has upgraded to much
improved flat-fielding, bias subtraction, and handling of bad columns
and pixels in the data.  Sky subtraction has been improved, especially
in the red, by allowing a gradient in the sky brightness across a
spectroscopic plate.  The spectrophotometric flux calibration is
improved as well, as is the correction for absorption lines from the
Earth's atmosphere.  The spectrophotometry is still not perfect,
however; the detailed slope of the continuum of objects can be
systematically off by as much as 20% in the flux in the extremes, and
one occasionally finds artificial features near the dichroic (i.e.,
around 6000 Angstroms) of a few percent, and features in the blue as
large as 5-10%.  </p>

<p> The above statements about the quality of the spectrophotometry
hold for point sources.  For extended sources, the definition of
spectrophotometry itself becomes somewhat ambiguous (see the
discussion in Section 4.10 of the EDR paper).  In particular, in the
presence of spectral gradients, the smear calibrations may be
difficult to interpret for extended objects. </p>

<h3>Saturated emission lines</h3>

<p> On occasion, bright emission lines in objects such as compact
star-forming galaxies will saturate, causing line ratios to become
meaningless.  The relevant pixels are usually (but not always) flagged
as having exactly zero flux errors.  </p>

<h3>Better continuum and line fits</h3>

<p>There have been upgrades to the continuum and line-fitting routines
in the spectro1d pipeline.  Improved stellar templates have much
improved the classification of unusual types of stars.  Comparison of
two parallel versions of the redshift/classification code shows an
error rate of only 0.5%, with an additional 1% of spectra of too low
signal-to-noise ratio to allow unambiguous classification.  The DR1
released spectroscopic data have used this comparison to recognize
errors in the redshifts, and update them accordingly; we therefore
expect that the number of incorrect redshifts in the final outputs for
objects of reasonable signal-to-noise ratio to be no more than a few
tenths of a percent. </p>

<h3>Spectroscopic classification of galaxies and the eClass parameter</h3>

<p>The galaxy spectral classification eigentemplates for DR1 are
created from a much larger sample of spectra than were used in the
EDR, now approximately 200,000.  The eigenspectra used in DR1 are an
early version of those created by Yip et al.<!-- reference XXX --></p>

<p>eClass is a single-parameter classifier based on the expansion
coefficients (eCoeff1-5) (see EDR).  The sign of the second
eigenspectrum has been reversed with respect to that of EDR; therefore
we recommend using the expression atan(-eCoeff2/eCoeff1) rather than
eClass as the single-parameter classifier.  This will retain the sense
of negative values denoting early-type spectra as was the case in EDR
and also Yip et al.  This will become the definition in spectro rerun
23, which will be contained in the final release of DR1.</p>
