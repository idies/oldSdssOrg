<p>The SDSS photometry is intended to be on the AB system <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O">(Oke
&amp; Gunn 1983)</a>, by which a magnitude 0 object should have the
same counts as a source of <span class="eqn">F<sub>nu</sub></span> =
3631 Jy.  However, this is known not to be exactly true, such that the
photometric zeropoints are slightly off the AB standard.  We continue
to work to pin down these shifts.  Our present estimate, based on
comparison to the STIS standards of <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2001AJ....122.2118B">Bohlin,
Dickinson, & Calzetti~(2001</a>) and confirmed by SDSS photometry and
spectroscopy of fainter hot white dwarfs, is that the <var>u</var>
band zeropoint is in error by 0.04 mag, <var>u</var><sub>AB</sub> =
<var>u</var><sub>SDSS</sub> - 0.04 mag, and that <var>g, r</var>, and
<var>i</var> are close to AB.  These statements are certainly not
precise to better than 0.01 mag; in addition, they depend critically
on the system response of the SDSS 2.5-meter, which was measured by
Doi et al. (2004, in preparation).  The <var>z</var> band zeropoint is
not as certain at this time, but there is mild evidence that it may be
shifted by about 0.02 mag in the sense <var>z</var><sub>AB</sub> =
<var>z</var><sub>SDSS</sub> + 0.02 mag.  The large shift in the
<var>u</var> band was expected because the adopted magnitude of the
SDSS standard BD+17 in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1996AJ....111.1748F">Fukugita
et al.(1996)</a> was computed at zero airmass, thereby making the
assumed <var>u</var> response bluer than that of the USNO system
response.</p>
