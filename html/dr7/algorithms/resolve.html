<h1>Resolving Multiple Detections and Defining Samples</h1>

<p>In addition to reading this section, we recommend that users
familiarize themselves with the <a
href="../products/catalogs/flags_detail.html#status">status flags</a>,
which indicate what happened to each object during the Resolve
procedure.</p>

<p>SDSS scans overlap, leading to duplicate detections of objects in
the overlap regions.  A variety of unique (i.e., containing no
duplicate detections of any objects) well-defined (i.e., areas with
explicit boundaries) samples may be derived from the SDSS database.
This section describes how to define those samples.  The <a
href="./resolve.eps">resolve figure</a> is a useful visual aid for the
discussion presented below.</p>

<p>Consider a single drift scan along a stripe, called a <em>run</em>.
The camera has six columns of CCDs, which scan six swaths across the
sky.  A given camera column is referred to throughout with the
abbreviation <em>camCol</em>.  The unit for data processing is the
data from a single camCol for a single run.  The same data may be
processed more than once; repeat processing of the same run/camCol is
assigned a unique <em>rerun</em> number.  Thus, the fundamental unit of
data process is identified by run/rerun/camCol.</p>

<p>While the data from a single run/rerun/camCol is a <em>scan
line</em> of data 2048 columns wide by a variable number of rows
(approximately 133000 rows per hour of scanning), for purposes of data
processing the data is split up into frames 2048 columns wide by 1361
rows long, resulting in approximately 100 frames per scan line per
hour of scanning.  Additionally, the first 128 rows from the next
frame is added to the previous frame, leading to frames 2048 columns
wide by 1489 rows long, where the first and last 128 rows overlap the
previous and next frame, respectively.  Each frame is processed
separately.  This leads to duplicate detections for objects in the
overlap regions between frames.  For each frame, we split the overlap
regions in half, and consider only those objects whose centroids lie
between rows 64 and 1361+64 as the unique detection of that object for
that run/rerun/camCol.  These objects have the OK_RUN bit set in the
"status" bit mask.  Thus, if you want a unique sample of all objects
detected in a given run/rerun/camCol, restrict yourself to all objects
in that run/rerun/camCol with the OK_RUN bit set.  The boundaries of
this sample are poorly defined, as the area of sky covered depends on
the telescope tracking.  Objects must satisfy other criteria as well
to be labeled OK_RUN; an object must not be flagged BRIGHT (as there
is a duplicate ``regular'' detection of the same object); and must not
be a deblended parent (as the children are already included); thus it
must not be flagged BLENDED unless the NODEBLEND flag is set.  Such
objects have their <em>GOOD</em> bit set.</p>

<p>For each stripe, 12 non-overlapping but contiguous <em>scan lines</em> are
defined parallel to the stripe great circle (that is, they are bounded by two
lines of constant great circle latitude).  Each scan line is 0.20977 arcdegrees
wide (in great circle latitude).  Each run/camCol scans along one
of these scan lines, completely covering the extent of the scan line in
latitude, and overlapping the adjacent scan lines by approximately 1 arcmin.
Six of these scan lines are covered when the "north" strip of the stripe is
scanned, and the remaining six are covered by the "south" strip.
The fundamental unit for defining an area of the sky considered as observed
at sufficient quality is the <em>segment</em>.  A segment consists of all
OK_RUN objects for a given run/rerun/camCol contained within a rectangle
defined by two lines of constant great circle longitude (the east and west
boundaries) and two lines of constant great circle latitude (the north and
south boundaries, being the same two lines of constant great circle latitude
which define the scan line).  Such objects have their OK_SCANLINE bit set in
the status bit mask.  A segment consists of a contiguous set of fields, but
only portions of the first and/or last field may be contained within the
segment, and indeed a given field could be divided between two adjacent
segments.
If an object is in the first field in a segment, then its FIRST_FIELD bit is
set, along with the OK_SCANLINE bit; if its not in the first field in the
segment, then the OK_SCANLINE bit is set but the FIRST_FIELD bit is not set.
This extra complication is necessary for fields which are split between two
segments; those OK_SCANLINE objects without the FIRST_FIELD bit set would
belong to the first segment (the segment for which this field is the last
field in the segment), and those OK_SCANLINE objects with the FIRST_FIELD
bit set would belong the the second segment (the segment for which this field
is the first field in the segment).</p>

<p>A <em>chunk</em> consists of a non-overlapping contiguous set of segments
which span a range in great circle longitude over all 12 scan lines for a
single stripe.  Thus, the set of OK_SCANLINE (with appropriate attention to
the FIRST_FIELD bit) objects in all segments for a given chunk comprises
a unique sample of objects in an area bounded by two lines of constant great
circle longitude (the east and west boundaries of the chunk) and two lines of
constant great circle latitude (+- 1.25865 degrees, the north and south
boundaries of the chunk).</p>

<p> Segments and chunks are defined in great circle coordinates along their given
stripe, and contain unique detections only when limited to other segments and
chunks along the same stripe.  Each stripe is defined by a great circle, which
is a line of constant latitude in survey coordinates (in survey coordinates,
lines of constant latitude are great circles while lines of constant longitude
are small circles, switched from the usual meaning of latitude and longitude).
Since chunks are 2.51729 arcdegrees wide, but stripes are separated by 2.5
degrees (in survey latitude), chunks on adjacent stripes can overlap (and
towards the poles of the survey coordinate system chunks from more than two
stripes can overlap in the same area of sky).  A unique sample of objects
spanning multiple stripes may then be defined by applying additional cuts in
survey coordinates.  For a given chunk, all objects that lie within +- 1.25
degrees in survey latitude of its stripe's great circle have the OK_STRIPE
bit set in the "status" bit mask.  All OK_STRIPE objects comprise a unique
sample of objects across all chunks, and thus across the entire survey area.
The southern stripes (stripes 76, 82, and 86) do not have adjacent stripes,
and thus no cut in survey latitude is required;  for the southern stripes
only, all OK_SCANLINE objects are also marked as OK_STRIPE, with no additional
survey latitude cuts.</p>

<p>Finally, the official survey area is defined by two lines of constant survey
longitude for each stripe, with the lines being different for each stripe.
All OK_STRIPE objects falling within the specified survey longitude boundaries
for their stripe have the PRIMARY bit set in the "status" bit mask.  Those
objects comprise the unique SDSS sample of objects in that portion of the
survey which has been finished to date.  Those
OK_RUN objects in a segment which fail either the great circle latitude cut for
their segment, or the survey latitude or longitude cut for their stripe, have
their SECONDARY bit set.  They do not belong to the primary sample, and
represent either duplicate detections of PRIMARY objects in the survey area,
or detections outside the area of the survey which has been finished to date.</p>

<p>Objects that lie close to the bisector between frames, scan lines, or chunks
present some difficulty. Errors in the centroids or astrometric calibrations
can place such objects on either side of the bisector. A resolution is
performed at all bisectors, and if two objects lie within 2 arcsec of each
other, then one object is declared OK_RUN/OK_SCANLINE/OK_STRIPE (depending on
the test), and the other is not.</p>
