<h3>The SDSS asinh magnitude system</h3>

<p>Magnitudes within the SDSS are expressed as inverse hyperbolic sine
(or ``asinh'') magnitudes, described in detail by <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?1999AJ....118.1406L"
target="new">Lupton, Gunn, & Szalay (1999)</a>. They are sometimes
referred to informally as <em>luptitudes</em> .  The transformation
from linear flux measurements to asinh magnitudes is designed to be
virtually identical to the standard astronomical magnitude at high
signal-to-noise ratio, but to behave reasonably at low signal-to-noise
ratio and even at negative values of flux, where the logarithm in the
<a href="../glossary/index.html#mag_pogson">Pogson magnitude</a>
fails.  This allows us to measure a flux even in the absence of a
formal detection; we quote no upper limits in our photometry.</p>

<p> The asinh magnitudes are characterized by a softening parameter
<em>b</em>, the typical 1-sigma noise of the sky in a PSF aperture in
1'' seeing.  The relation between detected flux <i>f</i> and asinh
magnitude <em>m</em> is:</p>

<div class="equation">m=-2.5/ln(10) * [asinh((f/f<sub>0</sub>)/(2b)) + ln(b)].</div>

<p>Here, <em>f<sub>0</sub></em> is given by the <em>classical</em>
zero point of the magnitude scale, i.e., <em>f<sub>0</sub></em> is the
flux of an object with <em>conventional</em> magnitude of zero.  The
quantity <em>b</em> is measured relative to <em>f<sub>0</sub></em>,
and thus is dimensionless; it is given in the <a
href="./fluxcal.html#asinh_table">table of asinh softening
parameters</a> (<a href="edr.tb21.html">Table 21 in the EDR
paper</a>), along with the asinh magnitude associated with a zero flux
object.  The table also lists the flux corresponding to
10<em>f<sub>0</sub></em>, above which the asinh magnitude and the
traditional logarithmic magnitude differ by less than 1% in flux.  For
details on converting asinh magnitudes to other flux measures, see <a
href="./fluxcal.html#counts2mag">converting counts to magnitudes</a>.

<a name="mag_fiber"></a>
<h3>Fiber magnitudes</h3>

<p>The flux contained within the aperture of a <a
href="../glossary/index.html#fiber">spectroscopic fiber</a> (3" in
diameter) is calculated in each band.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>For <a href="../glossary/index.html#child">children</a>
      of <a href="../glossary/index.html#deblend">deblended</a> galaxies,
      some of the pixels within a 1.5" radius may belong to other
      children; we now measure the flux of the parent at the position of the
      child; this properly reflects the amount of light which the
      spectrograph will see.</li>
  <li>Images are convolved to 2" seeing before fiberMags are
      measured. This also makes the fiber magnitudes closer to what is seen
      by the spectrograph.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="#top"><img alt="back to top" src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
</p>
<a name="mag_model"></a>
<h3>Model magnitudes</h3>


<p>The computation of model magnitudes in the DR1 and EDR processing
had a serious bug which implied that model magnitudes from the EDR and
DR1 should not be used for scientific analysis. The imaging data have
all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline,
that most importantly fixes an error in the model fits to each object.
The result is that the model magnitude is now a good proxy for point
spread function (PSF) magnitude for point sources, and Petrosian
magnitude (which have larger errors than model magnitude) for extended
sources.</p>

<p>Just as the <a href="#mag_psf">PSF magnitudes</a> are optimal
measures of the fluxes of stars, the optimal measure of the flux of a
galaxy would use a matched galaxy model.  With this in mind, the code
fits two models to the two-dimensional image of each object in each
band:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>A pure deVaucouleurs profile</b>
      <br>I(r) = I<sub>0</sub> exp{-7.67 [(r/r<sub>e</sub>)<sup>1/4</sup>]} <br>
      (truncated beyond <em>7r<sub>e</sub></em> to smoothly go to zero at
      <em>8r<sub>e</sub></em>, and with some softening within
      <em>r=r<sub>e</sub>/50</em>). </li>
  <li><b>A pure exponential profile</b><br>
      I(r) = I<sub>0</sub> exp(-1.68r/r<sub>e</sub>)<br>
      (truncated beyond <em>3r<sub>e</sub></em> to smoothly go to zero
      at <em>4r<sub>e</sub></em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each model has an arbitrary axis ratio and position angle.
Although for large objects it is possible and even desirable to fit
more complicated models (e.g., bulge plus disk), the computational
expense to compute them is not justified for the majority of the
detected objects.  The models are convolved with a double-Gaussian fit
to the PSF, which is provided by <span class="eqn">psp</span>.
Residuals between the double-Gaussian and the full KL PSF model are
added on for just the central PSF component of the image. These
fitting procedures yield the quantities </p>
<a name="modelfitpars"></a>
<ul>
  <li><span class="eqn">r_deV</span> and
      <span class="eqn"> r_exp</span>, the effective radii of the
      models;</li>
  <li><span class="eqn">ab_deV</span> and <span
      class="eqn">ab_exp</span>, the axis ratio of the best fit models;</li>
  <li><span class="eqn">phi_deV</span> and <span
      class="eqn">phi_exp</span>, the position angles of the ellipticity (in
      degrees East of North).</li>
  <li><span class="eqn">deV_L</span> and <span
      class="eqn">exp_L</span>, the likelihoods associated with each
      model from the chi-squared fit;</li>
  <li><span
      class="eqn">deVMag</span> and <span class="eqn">expMag</span>, the
      total magnitudes associated with each fit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these quantities correctly model the effects of the PSF.
Errors for each of the last two quantities (which are based only on
photon statistics) are also reported.  We apply aperture corrections
to make these model magnitudes equal the PSF magnitudes in the case of
an unresolved object.</p>

<a name="cmodel"></a>
<h4>Cmodel magnitudes</h4>
<p>The code now also takes the best fit exponential and de Vaucouleurs
fits in each band and asks for the linear combination of the two that
best fits the image.  The coefficient (clipped between zero and one)
of the de Vaucouleurs term is stored in the quantity <span
class="eqn">fracDeV</span> in the CAS. (In the flat files of the DAS,
this parameter is misleadingly termed <span
class="eqn">fracPSF</span>.) This allows us to define a <em>composite
flux</em>:</p>
<div class="equation"> F<sub>composite</sub> = fracDeV
F<sub>deV</sub> + (1 - fracDeV) F<sub>exp</sub>, </div>

<p>where <span class="eqn">F<sub>deV</sub></span> and
<span class="eqn">F<sub>exp</sub></span> are the de Vaucouleurs and exponential
fluxes (<em>not</em> magnitudes) of the object in question.  The
magnitude derived from <span class="eqn">F<sub>composite</sub></span>
is referred to below as the <span class="eqn">cmodel</span> magnitude (as distinct from
the <span>model</span> magnitude, which is based on the better-fitting of the
exponential and de Vaucouleurs models in the <var>r</var> band).</p>

<p>In order to measure unbiased colors of galaxies, we measure their
flux through equivalent apertures in all bands.  We choose the model
(exponential or deVaucouleurs) of higher likelihood in the <em>r</em>
filter, and apply that model (i.e., allowing only the amplitude to
vary) in the other bands after convolving with the appropriate PSF in
each band.  The resulting magnitudes are termed <span
class="eqn">modelMag</span>.  The resulting estimate of galaxy color
will be unbiased in the absence of color gradients.  Systematic
differences from Petrosian colors are in fact often seen due to color
gradients, in which case the concept of a global galaxy color is
somewhat ambiguous.  For faint galaxies, the model colors have
appreciably higher signal-to-noise ratio than do the Petrosian colors.
</p>

<p>There is now excellent agreement between <span
class="eqn">cmodel</span> and Petrosian magnitudes of galaxies, and
<span class="eqn">cmodel</span> and PSF magnitudes of stars. <span
class="eqn">Cmodel</span> and Petrosian magnitudes are not expected to
be identical, of course; as <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2002AJ....124.1810S">Strauss
et al. (2002)</a> describe, the Petrosian aperture excludes the outer
parts of galaxy profiles, especially for elliptical galaxies.  As a
consequence, there is an offset of 0.05-0.1 mag between <span
class="eqn">cmodel</span> and Petrosian magnitudes of bright galaxies,
depending on the photometric bandpass and the type of galaxy.  The rms
scatter between model and Petrosian magnitudes at the bright end is
now between 0.05 and 0.08 magnitudes, depending on bandpass; the
scatter between <span class="eqn">cmodel</span> and Petrosian
magnitudes for galaxies is smaller, 0.03 to 0.05 magnitudes.  For
comparison, the code that was used in the EDR and DR1 had scatters of
0.1 mag and greater, with much more significant offsets.</p>

<p>The <span class="eqn">cmodel</span> and PSF magnitudes of stars are
in good agreement (they are forced to be identical in the mean by
aperture corrections, as was true in older versions of the pipeline).
The rms scatter between model and PSF magnitudes for stars is much
reduced, going from 0.03 mag to 0.02 magnitudes, the exact values
depending on bandpass.  In the EDR and DR1, star-galaxy separation was
based on the difference between model and PSF magnitudes.  We now do
star-galaxy separation using the difference between <span
class="eqn">cmodel</span> and PSF magnitudes, with the threshold at
the same value (0.145 magnitudes).</p>

<p>Due to the way in which model fits are carried out, there is some
weak discretization of model parameters, especially <span
class="eqn">r_exp</span> and <span class="eqn">r_deV</span>. This is
yet to be fixed. Two other issues (negative axis ratios, and bad model
mags for bright objects) have been fixed since the EDR.  </p>

<a name="mag_petro"></a>
<h3>Petrosian magnitudes</h3>

<p>Stored as <span class="eqn">petroMag</span>. For galaxy photometry,
measuring flux is more difficult than for stars, because galaxies do
not all have the same radial surface brightness profile, and have no
sharp edges.  In order to avoid biases, we wish to measure a constant
fraction of the total light, independent of the position and distance
of the object. To satisfy these requirements, the SDSS has adopted a
modified form of the <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1976ApJ...209L...1P"
target="new">Petrosian (1976)</a> system, measuring galaxy fluxes
within a circular aperture whose radius is defined by the shape of the
azimuthally averaged light profile.  </p>

<p>We define the ``Petrosian ratio'' <em>R<sub>P</sub></em> at a
radius <em>r</em> from the center of an object to be the ratio of the
local surface brightness in an annulus at <em>r</em> to the mean
surface brightness within <em>r</em>, as described by <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2001AJ....121.2358B"
target="new">Blanton et al. 2001a</a>, <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?2001AJ....122.1104Y"
target="new">Yasuda et al. 2001</a>:<br> <img alt="back to top"
src="../shared_images/petroeq1.gif"><br clear="all"><p> where
<em>I(r)</em> is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile.
</p>

<p>The Petrosian radius <b><em>r<sub>P</sub></em></b> is defined as
the radius at which <em>R<sub>P</sub>(r<sub>P</sub>)</em> equals some
specified value <em>R<sub>P,lim</sub></em>, set to 0.2 in our
case. The Petrosian flux in any band is then defined as the flux
within a certain number <b><em>N<sub>P</sub></em></b> (equal to 2.0 in
our case) of <em>r</em> Petrosian radii:<br> <img alt="back to top"
src="../shared_images/petroeq2.gif"><br clear="all"> In the SDSS
five-band photometry, the aperture in all bands is set by the profile
of the galaxy in the <em>r</em> band alone.  This procedure ensures
that the color measured by comparing the Petrosian flux
<b><em>F<sub>P</sub></em></b> in different bands is measured through a
consistent aperture.  </p>

<p>The aperture <em>2r<sub>P</sub></em> is large enough to contain nearly all of
 the flux for typical galaxy profiles, but small enough that the sky noise in
<em>F<sub>P</sub></em> is small.  Thus, even substantial errors in 
<em>r<sub>P</sub></em> cause only
small errors in the Petrosian flux (typical statistical errors near
the spectroscopic flux limit of <em>r ~17.7</em> are &lt; 5%),
although these errors are correlated.  
</p>

<p>The Petrosian radius in each band is the parameter <span
class="eqn">petroRad</span>, and the Petrosian magnitude in each band
(calculated, remember, using only <span class="eqn">petroRad</span>
for the <em>r</em> band) is the parameter <span
class="eqn">petroMag</span>.

<p>In practice, there are a number of complications associated with
this definition, because noise, substructure, and the finite size of
objects can cause objects to have no Petrosian radius, or more than
one. Those with more than one are flagged as <span
class="eqn">MANYPETRO</span>; the largest one is used.  Those with
none have <span class="eqn">NOPETRO</span> set.  Most commonly, these
objects are faint (<em>r &gt; 20.5</em> or so); the Petrosian ratio
becomes unmeasurable before dropping to the limiting value of 0.2;
these have <span class="eqn">PETROFAINT</span> set and have their
``Petrosian radii'' set to the default value of the larger of 3" or
the outermost measured point in the radial profile.  Finally, a galaxy
with a bright stellar nucleus, such as a Seyfert galaxy, can have a
Petrosian radius set by the nucleus alone; in this case, the Petrosian
flux misses most of the extended light of the object.  This happens
quite rarely, but one dramatic example in the EDR data is the Seyfert
galaxy NGC 7603 = Arp 092, at RA(2000) = 23:18:56.6, Dec(2000) =
+00:14:38.  </p>

<p>How well does the Petrosian magnitude perform as a reliable and
complete measure of galaxy flux? Theoretically, the Petrosian
magnitudes defined here should recover essentially all of the flux of
an exponential galaxy profile and about 80% of the flux for a de
Vaucouleurs profile. As shown by Blanton et al. (2001a), this fraction
is fairly constant with axis ratio, while as galaxies become smaller
(due to worse seeing or greater distance) the fraction of light
recovered becomes closer to that fraction measured for a typical PSF,
about 95% in the case of the SDSS. This implies that the fraction of
flux measured for exponential profiles decreases while the fraction of
flux measured for deVaucouleurs profiles increases as a function of
distance. However, for galaxies in the spectroscopic sample
(<em>r&lt;17.7</em>), these effects are small; the Petrosian radius
measured by <span class="eqn">frames</span> is extraordinarily
constant in physical size as a function of redshift.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><img alt="back to top" src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a></p>
<a name="mag_psf"></a>

<h3>PSF magnitudes</h3>

<p>Stored as <span class="eqn">psfMag</span>. For isolated stars,
which are well-described by the point spread function (PSF), the
optimal measure of the total flux is determined by fitting a PSF model
to the object.  In practice, we do this by sync-shifting the image of
a star so that it is exactly centered on a pixel, and then fitting a
Gaussian model of the PSF to it.  This fit is carried out on the local
PSF KL model at each position as well; the difference between the two
is then a local aperture correction, which gives a corrected PSF
magnitude.  Finally, we use bright stars to determine a further
aperture correction to a radius of 7.4'' as a function of seeing, and
apply this to each frame based on its seeing.  This involved procedure
is necessary to take into account the full variation of the PSF across
the field, including the low signal-to-noise ratio wings.
Empirically, this reduces the seeing-dependence of the photometry to
below 0.02 mag for seeing as poor as 2''.  The resulting magnitude is
stored in the quantity <span class="eqn">psfMag</span>.  The flag
<span class="eqn">PSF_FLUX_INTERP</span> warns that the PSF photometry
might be suspect.  The flag <span class="eqn">BAD_COUNTS_ERROR</span>
warns that because of interpolated pixels, the error may be
under-estimated.  </p> 

<p><a href="#top"><img alt="back to top" src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif"
border=0></a></p>

<a name="reddening"></a>
<h3>The Reddening Correction</h3>

<p>Reddening corrections in magnitudes at the position of each object,
<span class="eqn">reddening</span>, are computed following Schlegel,
Finkbeiner & Davis (1998).  These corrections are <em>not</em> applied
to the magnitudes in the databases.  Conversions from <em>E(B-V)</em>
to total extinction <em>A<sub>lambda</sub></em>, assuming a
<em>z=0</em> elliptical galaxy spectral energy distribution, are
tabulated in Table 22 of the EDR Paper.  </p>


<p><a href="#top"><img alt="back to top"
src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a></p>

<a name="which_mags"></a>
<h3>Which Magnitude should I use?</h3>

<p>Faced with this array of different magnitude measurements to choose
from, which one is appropriate in which circumstances? We cannot give
any guarantees of what is appropriate for the science <em>you</em>
want to do, but here we present some examples, where we use the
general guideline that one usually wants to maximize some combination
of signal-to-noise ratio, fraction of the total flux included, and
freedom from systematic variations with observing conditions and
distance.</p>

<p>Given the excellent agreement between <span
class="eqn">cmodel</span> magnitudes (see <a href="#cmodel">cmodel
magnitudes</a> above) and PSF magnitudes for point sources, and
between <span class="eqn">cmodel</span> magnitudes and Petrosian
magnitudes (albeit with intrinsic offsets due to aperture corrections)
for galaxies, the <span class="eqn">cmodel</span> magnitude is now an
adequate proxy to use as a universal magnitude for all types of
objects.  As it is approximately a matched aperture to a galaxy, it
has the great advantage over Petrosian magnitudes, in particular, of
having close to optimal noise properties.</p>

<h4>Example magnitude usage</h4>
 <ul>
   <li><b>Photometry of Bright Stars</b>: If the objects are bright enough,
       add up all the flux from the profile <span
       class="eqn">profMean</span> and generate a large aperture
       magnitude.  We recommend using the first 7 annuli.</li>
   <li><b>Photometry of Distant Quasars</b>: These will be unresolved,
       and therefore have images consistent with the PSF.  For this reason,
       <span class="eqn">psfMag</span> is unbiased and optimal.</li>
   <li><b>Colors of Stars</b>: Again, these objects are unresolved, and <span
       class="eqn">psfMag</span> is the optimal measure of their
       brightness. </li>
   <li> <b>Photometry of Nearby Galaxies</b>: Galaxies bright enough to
       be included in our spectroscopic sample have relatively high
       signal-to-noise ratio measurements of their Petrosian magnitudes. Since
       these magnitudes are model-independent and yield a large fraction of
       the total flux, roughly constant with redshift,  <span class="eqn">petroMag</span>
       is the measurement of choice for such objects. In fact, the noise
       properties of Petrosian magnitudes remain good to <em>r=20</em> 
       or so. </li>
   <li><b>Photometry of Galaxies</b>: Under most conditions, the <span
       class="eqn">cmodel</span> magnitude is
       now a reliable estimate of the galaxy flux.  In addition, this
       magnitude account for the effects of local seeing and thus are
       less dependent on local seeing variations.</li>
   <li><b>Colors of Galaxies</b>: For measuring <em>colors</em> of
       extended objects, we continue to recommend using
       the model (not the <span class="eqn">cmodel</span>) magnitudes; the
       colors of galaxies were almost completely unaffected by the DR1
       software error.  The model magnitude is calculated using the
       best-fit parameters in the <var>r</var> band, and applies it to
       all other bands; the light is therefore measured consistently
       through the same aperture in all bands.</li>
 </ul>

<p> Of course, it would <em>not</em> be appropriate to study the
evolution of galaxies and their colors by using Petrosian magnitudes
for bright galaxies, and model magnitudes for faint galaxies.  </p>

 <p>Finally, we note that azimuthally-averaged radial profiles are also
provided, as described <a href="#photo_profile">below</a>, and can
easily be used to create circular aperture magnitudes of any desired
type. For instance, to study a large dynamic range of galaxy fluxes,
one could measure alternative Petrosian magnitudes with parameters
tuned such that the Petrosian flux includes a small fraction of the
total flux, but yields higher signal-to-noise ratio measurements at
faint magnitudes.  </p>

<p><a href="#top"><img alt="back to top" src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a></p>

<a name="photo_profile"></a>
<h3>Radial Profiles</h3>

 <p>The <span class="eqn"> frames</span> pipeline extracts an
azimuthally-averaged radial surface brightness profile. In the
catalogs, it is given as the average surface brightness in a series of
annuli.  This quantity is in units of ``maggies'' per square arcsec,
where a <em>maggie</em> is a linear measure of flux; one maggie has an
AB magnitude of 0 (thus a surface brightness of 20 mag/square arcsec
corresponds to 10<sup>-8</sup> maggies per square arcsec).  The number
of annuli for which there is a measurable signal is listed as <span
class="eqn"> nprof</span>, the mean surface brightness is listed as
<span class="eqn"> profMean</span>, and the error is listed as <span
class="eqn"> profErr</span>.  This error includes both photon noise,
and the small-scale ``bumpiness'' in the counts as a function of
azimuthal angle.</p>
 
<p>When converting the <span class="eqn"> profMean</span> values to a local surface
brightness, it is not the best approach to assign the mean
surface brightness to some radius within the annulus and then linearly
interpolate between radial bins.  Do not use smoothing
splines, as they will not go through the points in the cumulative
profile and thus (obviously) will not conserve flux. What <span class="eqn"> frames</span>
does, e.g., in determining the Petrosian ratio, is to fit a taut spline to the
<em>cumulative</em> profile and then differentiate that spline fit,
after transforming both the radii and cumulative profiles with asinh
functions.  We recommend doing the same here.</p>

<p>The annuli used are:</p>
