<h3>What is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) was one of the most ambitious scientific projects of all time. Its 
primary science goal was to make a high-quality three-dimensional map of the universe. The survey 
used a specially-built 2.5-meter telescope in New Mexico and a CCD camera to 
take images of about one-quarter of the night sky. It entire dataset is now available online to astronomers and the 
general public.</p>

<p>The SDSS has taken images of more than 300 million objects. The survey has already completed a preliminary map 
of the universe, and has made many scientific discoveries from our Solar System to the edge of the Universe. The SDSS's discoveries are 
detailed in the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/signature.html" target="sdss">Science</a> section of the sdss.org website (link opens in a new window).</p>

<p>
SDSS data can be accessed in two ways. It can be viewed as catalog data (measured parameters for sky objects) or 
as FITS images and data files. Catalog data, along with preview images and spectra, are available from the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/">Catalog Archive Server</a>. 
FITS images and data are available from the <a href="http://das.sdss.org">Data Archive Server</a>.

<a href="http://skyserver.sdss.org">SkyServer</a> is a web site where students and members of the general public can get data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). SkyServer shares 
many data access tools with the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/">Catalog Archive Server</a>, but also includes some tools designed specifically for the public. 
SkyServer's <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/dr7/en/proj/">Projects</a> are excellent resources for astronomy educators who want to include real data in 
their courses.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS takes data in long, narrow "stripes." See the <a href="../coverage/index.html" target="help">Sky Coverage</a> page (link opens 
in a new window) for maps and tables that show where in 
they sky the current data come from. The CAS <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/chart/navi.asp" target="tools">Navigate</a> tool (new window) 
also has an interactive sky globe that shows where the SDSS has data. To see if a specific area has been seen

<p>When you search for data in the SDSS, you are going through the SDSS database and looking for objects that match criteria you 
choose. For simple searches of photometric data, use the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/iqs.asp" target="tools">Inaging Query Form</a> 
(new window). For simple searches of spectroscopic data, use the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/sqs.asp" target="tools">Spectroscopic Query Form</a> 
(new window). For more complex searches, 
use <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/sql.asp" target="tools">Structured Query Language (SQL)</a>. See the CAS's 
guide on <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/howto/search/">Searching for Data</a> to learn more about SQL. To see thumbnail results of 
objects that meet your criteria, use the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/tools/chart/list.asp" target="tools">Image List</a> tool

<h3>Why doesn't the SDSS have data for well-known visible stars (Sirius, Vega, etc.)?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS has a very sensitive <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/public/en/sdss/instruments/instruments.asp">camera</a>. 
Stars that you can see with your unaided eyes are a little too bright for the SDSS's camera, so they show up as 
washed out. The SDSS still gets an image of those stars (for example, here is an image of <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/public/en/tools/chart/navi.asp?ra=116.2997&dec=28&scale=10" 
target="tools">Pollux</a> from SkyServer - link opens in a new window), but their images are unreliable, and the SDSS gets no catalog data.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS distinguishes between stars and galaxies based on their shapes: single points of light are stars, and 
fuzzy patches of light are galaxies. Some stars are bright enough that their light washes out the camera, so 
to the SDSS's camera, they look like fuzzy disks instead of single points of light. Their appearance fools the 
SDSS's software into classifying them as galaxies.</p>
</li>



<li>
<a name="longID"></a>
<h3>What does the long SDSS ID number mean, and how do I work with it?</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The SDSS needs a way to uniquely identify every object in the database, so it generates ID numbers. The ID numbers are code numbers that 
include information about how the object was observed.</p>

<p>One very important point when working with SkyServer is that the object IDs are so long that they get cut off in Excel, and show up with 
000 as the last three digits. This means you won't be able to find your objects anymore! To get around this problem, see this 
<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/public/en/howto/graph/caveat.asp">workaround</a>.</p>

<p>The SDSS measures magnitudes through <i>ugriz</i> filters, which give <i>ugriz</i> magnitudes. These magnitudes can be converted into UBVRI magnitudes using

&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>Because the survey imaging and processing was improved over the course of the survey, the SDSS
often obtained improved photometric measurements of objects AFTER they have 
been chosen ("<a href="../glossary/index.html#target">targeted</a>") for spectroscopy. However, it is important 
to keep a record of the photometric measurements at the time objects were targeted. We therefore maintain two versions of the photometric catalog:
</p>

 <ol>
 <li><b>Target:</b><p> Known as TARGDR7 in the DR7 CAS, this database contains the 
photometric catalogs AS THEY WERE WHEN OBJECTS WERE CHOSEN FOR SPECTROSCOPY. 
This database contains the union of all target <a href="../glossary/index.html#chunk">chunks</a>. It may cover a slightly
different area than <a href="../glossary/index.html#best">Best</a>, blended objects may be 
<a href="../glossary/index.html#deblend">deblended</a> differently, 
image quality may be worse, and photometric calibration may be less accurate. 
However, if you want to see what the SDSS thought the magnitudes and other 
properties of an object were when it was chosen for spectroscopy, this is the
place to look. Note that this database DOES NOT contain links from the 
photometric objects to the spectroscopy (you can always get the Target data 
for spectroscopic objects using the TargObjID field in the <code>SpecObjAll</code> table), 
nor does it contain the <a href="../glossary/index.html#tiling">tiling</a> information. This is because the Target 
database is intended to be a snapshot of the survey before any spectroscopy 
is done.</p></li>
 <li><b>Best:</b><p> Known as BESTDR7 in the DR7 CAS, this database contains the latest,
best versions of the imaging data, processed with the latest version of the 
photometric processing software, and with the most recent understanding of the
photometric calibration applied. For any science based on object photometry, 
you will want to use the Best data. In addition, only the Best database 
contains all of the spectroscopy and tiling information.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between <em>SpecObj</em> and <em>SpecObjAll</em>? What does 
<em>sciencePrimary</em> mean?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>

<p>The <code>SpecObjAll</code> table contains ALL spectroscopic objects, regardless 
of their status in the survey. Queries on this table can produce unusual or undesired objects. Thus, we have created the <code>SpecObj</code> 
view, which contains data for ONLY those fibers defined as SciencePrimary. To be defined as SciencePrimary, an object <em>must</em> meet all of the following criteria:
</p>
<ol class="med">
<li>It was <a href="../glossary/index.html#target">targeted</a> in the target <a href="../glossary/index.html#skyversion">skyVersion</a></li>
<li>The <a href="../glossary/index.html#plate">plate</a> on which the spectrum was taken is the primary observation of that 
    <a href="../glossary/index.html#tile">tile</a></li>
<li>The plate was a main survey plate (not part of the Southern survey or a special project)</li>
<li>The objType is <em>not</em> QA, SKY, or SPECTROPHOTO_STD (these object types are repeatedly observed)</li>
<li>The <a href="../glossary/index.html#fiber">fiber</a> was mapped correctly (this is the <code>zWarning</code> check)</li>
</ol>
<p>
As a result, some plates may have many (or even all) of their fibers excluded from SpecObj. Some instances where this occurs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fibers and plates that were targeted but are outside the official survey boundaries. These objects cannot be matched to a 
<em>PhotoPrimary</em> in the <a href="../glossary/index.html#target">target</a>) version of the sky so they do not make it into <code>SpecObj</code>. 
<a href="../glossary/index.html#plate">Plates</a> 344-346, 348, and 364 (tileRun 6) have 0 SpecObjs. Other plates from 
<a href="../glossary/index.html#tile">tile</a> runs 4 and 6 have reduced numbers of objects, especially 315 and 342. This could affect plates 
266-315, 363, 361 from tileRun 4 and plates 342-348, 364 from tileRun 6.</li>

<li>Fibers where objType = 'SKY' do not show up in the <code>SpecObj</code> view. Some plates (for undetermined reasons) have large numbers of sky fibers: Plate
417 has 214 sky fibers, and they all seem to be on one half of the plate; Plate 595 has 91 SKYs and Plate 359 has 84 SKYs.
</li>

<li>Fibers where objType = 'QA' also do not show up in the <code>SpecObj</code> view.
Below is a table of the plates with more than 100 QA fibers and the number 
of such fibers:<br>
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Plate</th><th># of QA fibers</th></tr>
<tr><td align="center">483</td><td align="center">174</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">471</td><td align="center">136</td></tr>

<tr><td align="center">418</td><td align="center">120</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">550</td><td align="center">108</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note:</b> The definition of <b>SciencePrimary</b> relies purely on spectroscopic and geometric considerations. There are objects 
in <code>SpecObj</code> which <em>do not</em> have a corresponding <b>Best</b> photometric object.</p>

<h3>What are the differences between <em>PhotoObj</em>, <em>PhotoTag</em>, and <em>PhotoObjAll</em>?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p><em>PhotoObjAll</em> is a table in the Best and Target databases which contains 
<b>all</b> of the measured photometric quantities for <b>all</b> of the imaging objects.
Because we measure hundreds of parameters for each of 340 million objects, this is a 
very large table, and queries can take very long to run.</p>

<p>In an effort to speed up queries, we have created a table with only a subset of the 
parameters that are requested most often (a "thin table"). This table is 
called <em>PhotoTag</em>. If you have a query that uses and returns only values 
stored in <em>PhotoTag</em>, it will execute much faster than if you used <em>PhotoObjAll</em>.</p>
<p>
In addition, we have created a view of <em>PhotoObjAll</em> that contains only those objects that are 
<a href="../glossary/index.html#primary">Primary</a> or <a href="../glossary/index.html#secondary_object">Secondary</a>. 
This view is called <em>PhotoObj</em>. 
Because this view effectively contains fewer objects than PhotoObjAll (but all the measured quantities for these objects), queries will 
execute faster.</p>
<p>
Given the above, you should consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>Querying from <span class="eqn">PhotoTag</span> if it contains everything you are looking for</li>
<li>Querying from <span class="eqn">PhotoObj</span> otherwise, UNLESS you are interested in data for objects which are 
<em>neither PRIMARY nor SECONDARY</em>. In that case, you will need to use <em>PhotoObjAll</em>.</li>
<li>Importantly, the "shorthand" quantities <em>u,g,r,i,z</em> do <u>not</u> exist in 
the <em>PhotoTag</em> table (because we want to keep it as thin as possible). Instead, you must use 
ModelMag_[ugriz], which is indexed to make queries faster. 
<b>HOWEVER</b>, in <em>PhotoObjAll</em> and its views, only the <em>u,g,r,i,z</em> are indexed, 
and <em>not</em> the ModelMags!</li>
</ol>
<p>
Because PhotoTag has many fewer parameters, larger portions of it can be cached, improving performance. We have found that for almost 
all queries which contain parameters fully in <wm>PhotoTag</wm>, it is faster. If you were looking for objects that had 
been detected multiple times, the fastest approach would be to perform a join on <em>PhotoTag</em> with itself, 
requiring that one object be Primary and the other Secondary.</p>

<h3>How do I get photometry for spectroscopic objects? What is the <em>SpecPhotoAll</em> table?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>The <em>SpecPhotoAll</em> table is a precomputed join between the <a href="../glossary/index.html#best">Best</a> 
<em>PhotoObjAll</em> and <em>SpecObjAll</em> tables. It includes the most requested parameters from these two tables, as well as a 
few pieces of information about <a href="../glossary/index.html#tiling">tiling</a>. It also includes the TargetObjID, which allows user to 
retrieve the <a href="../glossary/index.html#target">Target</a> version of the photometry.</p> 

<p>Note that all spectro-photo matches are not included in SpecPhotoAll, since there are additional JOIN conditions imposed on tiling and
targeting information.  The actual SQL fragment from the SpecPhotoAll construction is shown below to indicate all the JOINs involved: </p>
<table align='center'>
<tr><td class='code'>
	FROM SpecObjAll s
             <dd>JOIN TileAll w ON s.tile=w.tile
             <dd>LEFT OUTER JOIN TilingInfo t ON s.targetid=t.targetid and w.tileRun=t.tileRun
             <dd>JOIN TargetInfo i on s.targetObjid=i.targetObjid
             <dd>LEFT OUTER JOIN PhotoObjAll p WITH (nolock) ON s.bestObjid=p.objid
             <dd>LEFT OUTER JOIN PhotoTag q ON p.objid=q.objid
</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="eqn">SpecPhotoAll</span> is very useful for viewing and comparing objects' photometric and spectroscopic properties.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between <em>SpecPhoto</em> and <em>SpecPhotoAll</em>?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>As described above, <em>SpecPhotoAll</em> is a precomputed join between the <a href="../glossary/index.html#best">Best</a> 
<em>PhotoObjAll</em> and <em>SpecObjAll</em> tables. This includes non-science objects, and a variety of objects many users will not 
be interested in. The <em>SpecPhoto</em> view includes only those pairs where the SpecObj is a sciencePrimary 
(<a href="#scienceprimary">see the definition above</a>), and the 
BEST PhotoObj is a <a href="../glossary/index.html#primary">PRIMARY</a> object.

<h3>Why do z and zErr (in SpecObj) have different numerical precisions?</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>
Internally, these numbers are stored to their full precision as they come out
of the spectroscopic pipeline. When you perform a query, they have some
default string format applied that cuts them to what you see. But you can use
SQL's str() function to change the string format to whatever you like.</p>

<p>To get z to 6 decimals, for example, change your query to 'select str(z,8,6) as z'
instead of just z, and analogously for zErr. This applies the function str()
to the values in column z and returns the result with column label z (without
the "as", the result of a function has no column label). The
str(col,length,dec) function takes the numerical value in 'col' and formats it
as a string of length 'length' and with 'dec' significant digits. In other words, 
str(z,8,6) is the SQL equivalent to the C function printf("%8.6f",z). str() rounds the
result to the number of decimals you request.  </p>

<h3>How do I change the default precision of values in the output of my query?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>Use the <b>str(<i>column</i>,<i>n</i>,<i>d</i>)</b> SQL construct (where <i>n</i> is the total number
of digits and <i>d</i> is the number of decimal places) to set the precision of the column that your query requests.
SkyServer returns values with a default precision that is set for each data type, and this may not
be enough precision for some types of science. See the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/realquery.asp#nbrrun" target="help">Selected neighbors in run</a> or
the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/realquery.asp#qcomplete" target="help">Uniform Quasar Sample</a> sample queries (both open in 
new windows) for examples of how to use STR.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between <em>specClass</em> and <em>objType</em> for
spectroscopic objects, and which one should I use?
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>
The <em>objType</em> parameter in <span class="eqn">SpecObj</span> and other tables is set when the objects are targeted 
for spectroscopy, when the spectroscopic plates are prepared.  The <em>specClass</em> parameter is set by the spectroscopic 
pipeline after the spectrum is observed. For science, you should use the specClass attribute. The objType field is included 
for studies of the targeting algorithm.

<h3>Why does SDSS use the long (64-bit) objID fields, and what is the composition of the PhotoObj 
<span class="vocabulary">objID</span> and SpecObj <span class="vocabulary">specObjID</span> fields?</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" ALT="Back to Top" NOSAVE BORDER="1" HEIGHT="15" WIDTH="20" ALIGN="TOP"><small>Top</small></a></h3>
<p>
The 64-bit ID fields are required as primary keys (unique identifiers) in the SDSS database tables.  They are used to uniquely identify
each record in the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/intro.asp#indices" target="help">database indices</a> (link opens in a new window) for enhanced 
performance.  Each of them are bit-encoded with information about the observational origin, i.e., the run,rerun, camera column, etc. for 
photometric data, and the plate, MJD, fiberID etc. for spectroscopic objects.  
Please see the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/algorithm.asp?key=objID" target="tools">entry for SDSS ObjID Encoding</a> (new window) in the Algorithms page.
