<em>Suggested rules for the new web page</em>
<ol>
<li> There shall be section numbers to the necessary hierarchy level
    (I have no idea how to implement this in a flexible way, though -
    this is an area where we might need outside web consultants)
<li> The nav-bar shall show clearly where in the hierarchy the
  current page is
<li> The ``up'', ``next'', ``previous'' menubar items available in
  some browsers shall be usable for navigating the site
<li> New top-level section names shall make it easy to find
  information already contained on DR6 and previous sites
<li> Perhaps we should call this the Sloan Digital Sky Survey<strong>s</strong>?
</ol>

Now the actual proposed layout, which could turn into the new
sdss.org/dr7 front page.

<h2>Overview &amp; other information</h2>

This section introduces all top-level concepts and terms to give a
broad overview, and so that we can refer to all important terms
before they get explained in detail (e.g. CAS, spectroscopic samples,
etc.).

Not sure if we still need ``where to start'' as we are trying to be
comprehensive here. We do, however, need to list all the <strong>technical and
data release papers</strong>, and at the beginning is a good place.

<h2>Surveys and coverage</h2>

SDSS-I and SDSS-II, which actually contains 3 surveys:
<ol>
<li> Legacy -- the completion of SDSS-I imaging and
  spectroscopy. Includes ``special-plate'' spectroscopy in the
  southern galactic cap.
<li> SEGUE -- the galactic-structure extension of SDSS-I. Some SEGUE
  imaging and spectra were taken as part of SDSS-I.
<li> Supernova survey -- repeat scans under any conditions
</ol>

Now follows one subsection per survey, which explains:
<ol>
<li> Motivation, scope
<li> Survey contents, strategy, quality criteria (including top-level
  description of data products, i.e. imaging, spectra,
  calibrations...)
<li> Sky and time coverage
</ol>

<strong>E.g.:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy
      <ul>
	<li>Scope - is like <a href="./start/aboutdr7.1.html">About
	    DR7.1</a> but restricted to legacy</li>
	<li>Survey contents, strategy, quality criteria - just a
	    paragraph as broad introduction, with links to appropriate
	    subsections of the next section, and perhaps with a
	    summary table such as the current <a
	    href="./index.html">front page</a>
	<li><a href="./coverage/index.html">sky coverage</a> -
	    probably useful to show both the union of all surveys, and
	    the coverage of individual surveys.
      </ul>
  <li><a href="http://segue.uchicago.edu">SEGUE</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.sdss.org/drsn1/DRSN1_data_release.html">Supernova</a>
</ul>

<h2>Instruments</h2>

Pretty much as the existing <a
href="./instruments/index.html">instruments page</a>

<h2>Pipelines, algorithms &amp; products</h2>

This again has one subsection per survey, since they are by now
sufficiently different from each other. Each explains which pipelines
there are, and what they do.

My suggestion would be to structure this page following the actual
data flow, with links to both algorithms and products for every
stage. In this way, the distinction between 'products' and
'algorithms' and 'pipelines' would be lifted at the top level, and the
connection becomes clear. A basic version of this outline is on the <a
href="./dataflow/index.html">dataflow</a> page, and links to the
descriptions of <a href="./products/index.html">input/output data</a>
and <a href="./algorithms/index.html">algorithms</a> could be added
here, as well as to the <a href="./dm/flatFiles/FILES.html">data
model</a> <strong>which probably needs an overhaul, too</strong>.

<ol>
<li>Data flow overview
<li>Photometry
  <ol>
  <li> photo -- find objects and their properties in counts and
    pixels
  <li> calibration pipelines and methods
    <ol>
    <li> PSF
    <li> photometric, flat-fielding, ubercal
    <li> astrometric
    </ol>
  <li> Target selection, resolve concept of legacy, ``Primary''
    <ol>
    <li> All the spectro surveys
    </ol>
  <li> tiling, masks
  </ol>
<li> Data model for each pipeline (though this is starting to get
  into data-access land); TARGET and BEST; we need to document all the
  flaws that appear somewhere in TARGET photometry!
<li>top-level description of all QA things etc. which apply to more
    than one targeting category (e.g.)
</ol>

<h2>Data access</h2>

As <a href="./access/index.html">data access</a> now.

<h2>Known unfixed problems</h2>

As <a href="./help/known.html">known problems</a>now, except that it's
only a clearinghouse list with pointers to detailed information
further up -- doesn't need to be numbered, though?

<h2>FAQ</h2>

Should address most common how-to questions - with links to tutorials
where they answer the question

<h2>Tutorials</h2>

As <a href="./tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a> now -- except with heavy updating!

<h2>Help</h2>

As <a href="./help/index.html">help</a> now -- doesn't need to be
numbered, though?


<h2>Search</h2>

As <a href="./search/index.html">search</a> now -- doesn't need to be
numbered, though? Won't work until we're public!
