The data acquisition system petravick94 records information
from the imaging 
camera, spectrographs, and photometric telescope.  Data are
transferred via magnetic tape, with critical, low-volume samples sent
over the internet.  Each system uses report files to track the
observations.
<P>
Data from the imaging camera are collected in the Time Delay
Integration (TDI, or Drift Scan) mode.  We treat the data from each
imaging camera column of 5 photometric and 2 astrometric CCDs as a
<EM>scan line</EM>.  For convenience, data from each CCD are broken into
<EM>frames</EM> containing 1361 lines.  Before processing, the 128 rows from
the next frame are added to the top of each frame, so that the pipelines
work on 2048<IMG WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=16 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2843" SRC="img14.gif">1489 images. The resulting overlap
between reduced frames (128 rows) is roughly the same as the number of
columns that overlap with the other strip of a stripe. Some objects
are detected in more than one frame, but when loading the databases we
mark one of these detections as the ``primary'' detection (see the
discussion in &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node50.html#swresolve">4.7</A> below). The frames which correspond to
the same sky location in each of the five filters are grouped together
for processing as a <EM>field</EM>.  Frames from the astrometric CCDs are
not saved, but rather stars from them are detected and measured in
real time to provide feedback on telescope tracking and focus.  These
measurements are also written to magnetic tape.  This same analysis is
done for the photometric CCDs, and we save these results along with
the actual frames. Each night, a special bias run is taken to monitor
the bias levels on CCD amplifiers.
<P>
Data from the spectrographs are read from the four CCDs (one red channel
and one blue channel in each of the two spectrographs) after each
exposure.  A complete set of exposures includes bias, flat, arc,
smear, and science exposures taken through the fibers, as well as
a uniformly illuminated flat to take out pixel-to-pixel variations.
<P>
Data from the photometric telescope include bias frames, dome and
twilight flats for each filter, measurements of primary standards in
each filter, and measurements of our secondary calibration patches in
each filter.
<P>
All of these systems are supported by a common set of observers
programs, with observer interfaces customized for each system to
optimize our observing efficiency.
