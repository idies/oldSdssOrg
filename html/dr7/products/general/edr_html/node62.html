In order to assess the performance of the spectroscopic pipelines, we
determined the redshift and classification by hand of <EM>every</EM>
spectrum on 39 plates from the EDR (a total of roughly 23,000
spectra).  Comparing with the outputs of the pipeline, after manual
correction following the procedure outlined above, 
we find that 99.7% of galaxies, 97.9% of quasars, and
99.1% of stars are correctly classified, and the redshifts are
correct (to within a pixel or two as determined by eye) for 99.7% of
the galaxies, 98.0% of the quasars, and 99.6% of the stars.
<P>
We have also compared outputs for plates observed with multiple
pluggings, and have found that redshifts for galaxies in the main
sample are reproducible to of order 30 km s<IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2861" SRC="img20.gif">.  Finally, we have
compared our redshifts to those found in the literature (e.g., LCRS;
shectman96), and find differences consistent with their and
our quoted errors.  A similar comparison with the ENACS survey
enacs shows a mean offset of <IMG WIDTH=73 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3647" SRC="img191.gif"> km s<IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2861" SRC="img20.gif">,
and a dispersion of order 90 km s<IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2861" SRC="img20.gif">, a large part of which can be
accounted for by the ENACS estimated errors, which were confirmed with
repeated measurements.  A small number of redshifts from A119 have <IMG WIDTH=92 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3653" SRC="img192.gif">.  These have been traced to possible problems with redshifts for
several objects from a single ENACS pointing.
<P>
richards01a and schneider01 compare SDSS quasar
redshifts with those from NED, and find excellent agreement; in three
cases, they found that the NED redshifts were wrong, but in no case
was the NED redshift correct and the SDSS redshift wrong.
