In addition to science targets, about 50 fibers out of each plate of 640
are assigned by <TT>target</TT> for calibration spectra.  Since
spectroscopy requires good sky subtraction, 32 of these calibration
fibers are assigned to regions where the photometric pipeline detects
no objects (in fact, the photometric pipeline outputs several such
``sky objects'' in each frame for this purpose).  These sky fibers are
distributed so that each bundle of 20 fibers contains one; this
ensures that the sky fibers are reasonably uniformly distributed
around the plate.  In addition, 18 fibers per plate are assigned to
standard stars of various sorts; eight are spectrophotometric
standards, chosen to be F dwarfs, eight are reddening standards,
chosen to be F subdwarfs, and two are hot subdwarfs
(Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblfiberallocation">26</A>).  The spectrophotometric standards
are also used in correcting the strong telluric water absorption bands
in the red end of the science target spectra (the smoothness of the F
subdwarf spectra make them ideal for this purpose).  Conversely, the
hot subdwarfs are useful for calibrating the blue end of the science
target spectra.  Finally, as their name implies, the reddening
standards will be used for determining the reddening of our Galaxy.
