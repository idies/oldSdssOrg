<P>
We inspected the spectra of all EDR objects that were selected for
reasons other than being a galaxy, or which were classified by the
spectroscopic pipelines as not being a galaxy.  Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblamanda">31</A>
summarizes the number of quasars, galaxies, stars of various types,
unknown objects, and spectra that are defective for some reason.
We have prepared a catalog of all spectroscopically confirmed quasars
in the EDR by visually inspecting all the spectra. This catalog is
presented in schneider01, and is available on our web site.
<P>
Various spectroscopic samples may be constructed from the EDR.  
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblzhistsummary">32</A> summarizes the
number of objects with spectra in four broad target samples: ``Main Galaxy'',
``Luminous Red Galaxy'', ``Main Quasar'', and ``High Redshift
Quasar.''  In the table, we first list the number of targets selected
in each class (as well as in all ``other'' samples), and then the
number of spectra with high confidence and good status for the
redshift determination, respectively.  Finally, we list the number of
objects classified as galaxy, quasar, and neither, for each of the samples.
<P>
Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figZhistGlx">14</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figZhistQso">16</A> show the redshift
distributions for the galaxy and quasar samples, respectively.  The
contribution from each of the samples is shown, along with the
distribution of all redshifts for classified spectra.
Figures&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figWedgeEqGal">15</A> and&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figWedgeEqQso">17</A> are ``pie
charts'' for objects from the equatorial data (runs 94/125 and
752/756).
