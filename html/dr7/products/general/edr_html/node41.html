<P>
<A NAME="swphotoflux">&#160;</A>
<P>
We have discussed how <TT>frames</TT> detects, deblends, and designates
objects. This section and the next discuss the measurements applied to
each resulting object.  Each of the quantities described here has an
associated estimated error measured as well, unless otherwise
mentioned.  In this subsection, we discuss the various measurements made
of the flux in each object. 
The Asinh Magnitude Scale
<A NAME="swphotoluptitudes">&#160;</A>
<P>
We begin by describing the magnitude
scale which the SDSS uses. Unless otherwise specified (the most
important exceptions being <TT>petroMag</TT> and <TT>modelMag</TT>,
to get self-consistent colors), the measures discussed here are
applied independently in each band pass.
Magnitudes within the SDSS are expressed as inverse hyperbolic sine
(or ``asinh'') magnitudes, described in detail by Lupton, Gunn, &amp;
Szalay (1999). 
The transformation from linear flux measurements to asinh magnitudes
is designed to be virtually identical to the standard astronomical
magnitude pogson56 at high signal-to-noise ratio, but to behave
reasonably at low signal-to-noise ratio and even at negative values of flux,
where the logarithm in the Pogson magnitude fails.  This allows us
to measure a flux even in the absence of a formal detection; we quote
no upper limits in our photometry.
<P>
The asinh magnitudes are characterized by a softening parameter <I>b</I>,
the typical <IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3069" SRC="img70.gif"> noise of the sky in a PSF aperture in 1'' seeing.  The relation
between detected flux <I>f</I> and asinh magnitude <I>m</I> is (see equation&nbsp;(3) of lupton99):
<BR><A NAME="luptitude">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=514 HEIGHT=42 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation673" SRC="img71.gif"><BR>
where <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3075" SRC="img72.gif"> sets the zeropoint of the magnitude scale (see the
discussion in &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node44.html#swphotocal">4.5</A>, and especially &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node48.html#swphotocalassess">4.5.4</A>). 
The quantity <I>b</I> is measured relative to <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3075" SRC="img72.gif">,
and thus is dimensionless; it is given in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblbprime">21</A>, along with the asinh magnitude associated
with a zero flux object.
The table also
lists the flux corresponding to <IMG WIDTH=43 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3081" SRC="img73.gif">, above which the asinh
magnitude and the traditional logarithmic magnitude differ by less
than 1% in flux.
<P>
PSF Magnitudes
<A NAME="swphotomeasurepsfmags">&#160;</A>
<P>
For isolated stars, which are well-described by the PSF, the optimal
measure of the total flux is determined by fitting a PSF model to the
object.  In practice, we do this by sinc-shifting the image of a star
so that it is exactly centered on a pixel, and then fitting a Gaussian
model of the PSF to it.  This fit is carried out on the local PSF KL
model (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node35.html#swpsp">4.3</A>) at each position as well; the difference
between the two is then a local aperture correction, which gives a
corrected PSF magnitude.  Finally, we use bright stars to determine a
further aperture correction to a radius of 7.4'' as a function of
seeing, and apply this to each frame for its seeing.  This involved
procedure is necessary to take into account the full variation of the
PSF (measured in the <TT>psp</TT> described above) across the field,
including the low signal-to-noise ratio wings.  Empirically, this
reduces the seeing-dependence of the photometry to below 0.02 mag for
seeing as poor as 2''.  The resulting magnitude is stored in the
quantity <TT>psfMag</TT>.  As mentioned above, the flag <TT>
PSF_FLUX_INTERP</TT> warns that the PSF photometry might be suspect.
The flag <TT>BAD_COUNTS_ERROR</TT> warns that because of interpolated
pixels, the error may be under-estimated.
<P>
The PSF errors include contributions from photon statistics and
uncertainties in the PSF model and aperture correction, although they
do not include uncertainties in photometric calibration
(&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node44.html#swphotocal">4.5</A>).  Repeat observations show that 
these errors are probably underestimated by 10-20%.
<P>
Fiber Magnitudes
<A NAME="swphotomeasurefibermags">&#160;</A>
<P>
The flux contained within the aperture of a spectroscopic fiber
(3&nbsp;arcsec in diameter) is calculated in each band and stored in <TT>
fiberMag</TT>. Note that no correction for seeing is applied to this
measure of the magnitude.  For children of deblended galaxies, some of
the pixels within a 1.5&nbsp;arcsec radius may belong to other children. In
this case, the fiber magnitudes can be rather misleading, as they will
not reflect the amount of light which the spectrograph will see.
For future data releases, we will calculate the true flux within a fiber
diameter, including all light from the parent that falls in the aperture
centered at the location of the child.  We will also correct the
detected flux to a fiducial value of the seeing.
<P>
Petrosian Magnitudes
<A NAME="swphotomeasurepetromags">&#160;</A>
<P>
For galaxy photometry, measuring flux is more difficult than for
stars, because galaxies do not all have the same radial surface
brightness profile, and have no sharp edges.  In order to avoid
biases, we wish to measure a constant fraction of the total light,
independent of the position and distance of the object.  Please refer
to the discussion in strauss01. To satisfy these
requirements, the SDSS has adopted a modified form of the
petrosian76 system, measuring galaxy fluxes within a circular
aperture whose radius is defined by the <I>shape</I> of the azimuthally
averaged light profile.
<P>
We define the ``Petrosian ratio'' <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3087" SRC="img74.gif"> at a radius <I>r</I> from
the center of an object to be the ratio of the local surface
brightness in an annulus at <I>r</I> to the mean surface brightness within
<I>r</I>, as described by blanton01a, yasuda01, strauss01:
<BR><A NAME="petroratio">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=561 HEIGHT=57 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation700" SRC="img75.gif"><BR>
where <I>I</I>(<I>r</I>) is the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile.
<P>
The Petrosian radius <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3097" SRC="img76.gif"> is defined as the radius at which
<IMG WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3099" SRC="img77.gif"> equals some specified value <IMG WIDTH=46 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3101" SRC="img78.gif">, set
to 0.2 in our case. The
Petrosian flux in any band is then defined as the flux within a
certain number <IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3103" SRC="img79.gif"> (equal to 2.0 in our case) of <I>r</I> Petrosian radii:
<BR><IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=43 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation706" SRC="img80.gif"><BR>
In the SDSS five-band photometry, the aperture in all bands is set by
the profile of the galaxy in the <I>r</I> band alone.  This procedure ensures
that the color measured by comparing <IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3109" SRC="img81.gif"> in different bands is
measured through a consistent aperture.
<P>
The aperture <IMG WIDTH=28 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3111" SRC="img82.gif"> is large enough to contain nearly all of the
flux for typical galaxy profiles, but small enough that the sky noise in
<IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3109" SRC="img81.gif"> is small.  Thus, even substantial errors in <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3097" SRC="img76.gif"> cause only
small errors in the Petrosian flux (typical statistical errors near
the spectroscopic flux limit of <IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3117" SRC="img83.gif"> are <IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3119" SRC="img84.gif">),
although these errors are correlated.
<P>
The Petrosian radius in each band is the parameter <TT>petroRad</TT>, and
the Petrosian magnitude in each band (calculated, remember, using only
<TT>petroRad</TT> for the <I>r</I> band) is the parameter <TT>petroMag</TT>.
<P>
In practice, there are a number of complications associated with this
definition, because noise, substructure, and the finite size of
objects can cause objects to have no Petrosian radius, or more than
one. Those with more than one are flagged as <TT>MANYPETRO</TT>; the
largest one is used. 
Those with none have <TT>NOPETRO</TT> set.  Most commonly, these objects
are faint (<IMG WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3123" SRC="img85.gif"> or so); the 
Petrosian ratio becomes unmeasurable before dropping to the limiting
value of 0.2; 
these have <TT>PETROFAINT</TT> set and have
their ``Petrosian radii'' set to the default value of the larger
of 3&nbsp;arcsec or the outermost measured point in the radial profile.
Finally, a galaxy with a bright stellar nucleus, such as a Seyfert
galaxy, can have a Petrosian radius set by the nucleus alone; in this
case, the Petrosian flux misses most of the extended light of the
object.  This happens quite rarely, but one dramatic example in the
EDR data is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7603 = Arp 092, at <IMG WIDTH=57 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3125" SRC="img86.gif"> =
23:18:56.6, <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3127" SRC="img87.gif"> = +00:14:38.
<P>
How well does the Petrosian magnitude perform as a reliable and
complete measure of galaxy flux? Theoretically, the Petrosian
magnitudes defined here should recover essentially all of the flux of
an exponential galaxy profile and about 80% of the flux for a de
Vaucouleurs profile. As shown by blanton01a, this fraction is
fairly constant with axis ratio, while as galaxies become smaller (due
to worse seeing or greater distance) the fraction of light recovered
becomes closer to that fraction measured for a typical PSF, about 95%
in the case of the SDSS. This implies that the fraction of flux
measured for exponential profiles decreases while the fraction of flux
measured for de Vaucouleurs profiles increases as a function of
distance. However, for galaxies in the spectroscopic sample
(<IMG WIDTH=70 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3129" SRC="img88.gif">), these effects are small; 
the Petrosian radius measured by <TT>frames</TT> is extraordinarily constant
in physical size as a function of redshift (strauss01).
<P>
Model Fits
<A NAME="swphotomeasuremodelfits">&#160;</A>
<P>
Just as the PSF magnitudes are optimal measures of the fluxes of
stars, the
optimal measure of the flux of a galaxy would use a matched galaxy
model.  With this in mind, the code fits two models to the
two-dimensional image of each object in each band; a pure
de&nbsp;Vaucouleurs profile,
<BR><IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation720" SRC="img89.gif"><BR>
(truncated beyond <IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3131" SRC="img90.gif"> to smoothly go to zero at <IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3133" SRC="img91.gif">, and
with some softening within <IMG WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3135" SRC="img92.gif">), 
and a pure exponential profile, 
<BR><IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=18 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation723" SRC="img93.gif"><BR>
(truncated beyond <IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3137" SRC="img94.gif"> to smoothly go to zero at <IMG WIDTH=25 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3139" SRC="img95.gif">), each
of arbitrary axis ratio and position angle.  Although for large
objects it is possible and even desirable to fit more complicated
models (e.g., bulge plus disk), the computational expense to compute
them is not justified for the majority of the detected
objects<A NAME="tex2html11" HREF="footnode.html#1425"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/foot_motif.gif"></A>.  The models are convolved
with a double-Gaussian fit to the PSF, which is provided by <TT>psp</TT>.
Residuals between the
double-Gaussian and the full KL PSF model are added on for just the
central PSF component of the image.
<P>
At bright magnitudes (<IMG WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3141" SRC="img96.gif">), the model magnitudes are a poor
measure of the total flux of the galaxy, due to the fact that the fits
are restricted to the central parts of objects strateva01.
This issue will be addressed in future data releases.
<P>
These fitting procedures yield the quantities: <TT>r_deV</TT> and <TT>
r_exp</TT>, the effective radii of the models; <TT>ab_deV</TT> and <TT>
ab_exp</TT>, the axis ratio of the best fit models; and <TT>phi_deV</TT>
and <TT>phi_exp</TT>, the position angles of the ellipticity (in degrees
East of North).  Note that these quantities correctly model the
effects of the PSF.  Also recorded are the likelihoods 
associated with each model from the <IMG WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3143" SRC="img97.gif"> fit, <TT>deV_L</TT> and
<TT>exp_L</TT>, and the total magnitudes associated with each fit, <TT>
deVMag</TT> and <TT>expMag</TT>.  Errors for each of these quantities (which
are based only on photon statistics) are also reported.  We apply
aperture corrections to make these model magnitudes equal the PSF
magnitudes in the case of an unresolved object.
<P>
In order to measure unbiased colors of galaxies, we measure
their flux through equivalent apertures in all bands. 
We choose the model (exponential or
de Vaucouleurs) of higher likelihood in the <I>r</I> filter, and apply that model
(i.e., allowing only the amplitude to vary) in the other bands
after convolving with the appropriate PSF in each band.  The
resulting magnitudes are termed <TT>modelMag</TT>.  
The resulting estimate of galaxy color will be unbiased in the absence
of color gradients.  Systematic differences from Petrosian colors are
in fact often seen due to color gradients, in which case the concept
of a global galaxy color is somewhat ambiguous.  For faint galaxies,
the model colors have appreciably higher signal-to-noise ratio than do
the Petrosian colors.
<P>
Due to the way in which model fits are carried out, there is some weak
discretization of model parameters, especially <TT>r_exp</TT> and <TT>
r_deV</TT>. Also note that very
occasionally, the quoted axis ratios are given negative values.  These
two problems will be addressed in subsequent data releases.
<P>
Reddening
<A NAME="swphotoreddening">&#160;</A>
<P>
Reddening corrections in magnitudes at the position of each object,
<TT>reddening</TT>, are computed following schlegel98.  These
corrections are <EM>not</EM> applied to the magnitudes in the databases.
Conversions from <I>E</I>(<I>B</I>-<I>V</I>) to total extinction <IMG WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3149" SRC="img98.gif">, assuming a
<I>z</I>=0 elliptical galaxy spectral energy distribution, are
tabulated in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblreddening">22</A>.
<P>
Which Magnitudes Should One Use?
<A NAME="swphotomeasurechoices">&#160;</A>
<P>
Faced with this array of different magnitude measurements to choose
from, which one is appropriate in which circumstances? We cannot give
any guarantees of what is appropriate for the science <I>you</I> want
to do, but here we present some examples, where we use the general
guideline that one usually wants to maximize some combination of
signal-to-noise ratio, fraction of the total flux included, and freedom from
systematic variations with observing conditions and distance:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Photometry of Distant Quasars</B>:  These will be unresolved,
and therefore have images consistent with the PSF.  For this reason,
<TT>psfMag</TT> is unbiased and optimal.
<LI> <B>Colors of Stars</B>: Again, these objects are unresolved, and
<TT>psfMag</TT> is the optimal measure of their brightness.
<LI> <B>Photometry of Nearby Galaxies</B>: Galaxies bright enough to
be included in our spectroscopic sample have relatively high
signal-to-noise ratio measurements of their Petrosian magnitudes. Since
these magnitudes are model-independent and yield a large fraction of
the total flux, roughly constant with redshift, <TT>petroMag</TT>
is the measurement of choice for such objects. In fact, the noise
properties of Petrosian magnitudes remain good to <IMG WIDTH=56 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3015" SRC="img55.gif"> or so.
<LI> <B>Photometry of Distant Galaxies</B>: For the faintest galaxies,
estimates of the Petrosian magnitudes become very noisy. Under these
conditions, the <TT>modelMag</TT> is usually a more reliable estimate of the
galaxy flux.  In addition, these magnitudes account for the effects of local
seeing and thus are less dependent on local seeing variations.  This
property also is desirable for the faintest, smallest objects.  The
model <EM>colors</EM> for galaxies are also unbiased, as mentioned above. 
</UL>
Of course, it would <I>not</I> be appropriate to study the evolution of 
galaxies and their colors by using Petrosian magnitudes for bright 
galaxies, and model magnitudes for faint galaxies.
<P>
Finally, we note that azimuthally-averaged radial profiles are
provided, as described below, and can easily be used to create
circular aperture magnitudes of any desired type. For instance, to
study a large dynamic range of galaxy fluxes, one could measure
alternative Petrosian magnitudes with parameters tuned
such that the Petrosian flux includes a small fraction of the total
flux, but yields higher signal-to-noise ratio measurements at faint
magnitudes.
