<P>
The sdssQT is a stand-alone application to manage and perform catalog
archive server queries, and is available for download from our web
sites, along with a detailed user's manual.  The discussion that follows
is a brief introduction to its use, to illustrate its capabilities.
There are options to choose the output format (ASCII or binary),
facilities to save queries, a simple text editor to create and modify
queries, and communication with the Catalog Archive Server to follow
the progress (and predict the time to completion) of active queries.
An additional tool converts our binary output format to a FITS binary table.
<P>
The query language we developed is very similar to the Structured
Query Language (SQL).  The sdssQT includes several example queries,
and the online user's guide provides additional explanations of the
language and how to use it efficiently. The use of associations
(&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#ddclasses">2.2.1</A>)
provides a powerful way to extract object data from many different
classes simultaneously.  Similarly, the inheritance properties of
classes and their subclasses makes queries written for a given class
run on all of its subclasses or sibling classes.
<P>
The grammar of this language is to select a set of <TT>parameters</TT>
from a <TT>class</TT> that satisfy specified <TT>conditions</TT>.  The SDSS
Query Tool allows full access to all of the classes and parameters in
the Catalog Archive Server.  For example, the query:
<PRE>SELECT ra,dec FROM SpecObj WHERE (z &gt; 2)</PRE>
returns the parameters <TT>ra</TT> and <TT>dec</TT> (right ascension and declination)
for all spectroscopic objects (i.e., from the class <TT>SpecObj</TT>)
with redshift greater than 2.
<P>
One class must appear in the <TT>WHERE</TT>
clause. One or more 
of the parameters from the classes may be listed in the <TT>SELECT</TT> clause and used in
the <TT>WHERE</TT> clause, as long as they are included in the class
mentioned in the <TT>FROM</TT> clause.
<P>
The <TT>PhotoObj</TT> class, containing the detected objects in the
images, has the most entries, over 13 million.  To facilitate 
selecting from these entries, we have designated a subset of the
most commonly used parameters in
the <TT>PhotoObj</TT> class to be part of a special class called <TT>Tag</TT>.
The final column of Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblphoto">6</A> indicates which parameters are in
the <TT>Tag</TT> class.  The database is structured in such a way that
searches that select on these <TT>Tag</TT> parameters run significantly
faster.
<P>
Additionally, many of the classes, like <TT>Tag</TT>, have numerous
subclasses (<TT>Primary, Secondary, Galaxy, Star</TT>), described in the
above mentioned tables.  These subclasses all <I>inherit</I> the
properties of the umbrella class. The same parameters are available in
the subclasses as in the umbrella class, but they will be faster to
query as each contains only a portion of the total objects. For
example, users wanting data only on galaxies can execute queries on
the <TT>Galaxy</TT> class; this avoids having to specify that <TT>
objType=Galaxy</TT> if it were run on the entire <TT>Tag</TT> class, and will
run faster as fewer objects are searched.
<P>
To access <EM>associated</EM>, or linked parameters, we use the ``.''
modifier.  For example, spectroscopic objects from the <TT>SpecObj</TT>
class all have a link back to the photometric object in the <TT>Tag</TT>
class. This allows retrieval of parameters from both classes simultaneously.
Use the syntax <TT>tag.r</TT>, for example, to obtain a spectroscopic target's
<IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2863" SRC="img21.gif"> magnitude.  In Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecobj">11</A>, the parameter <TT>
phototag</TT> has type <TT>OneAssoc(PhotoTag)</TT>, so the query
<PRE>SELECT ra,dec,phototag.r FROM SpecObj</PRE>
returns the position and <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2863" SRC="img21.gif"> magnitude for all objects with spectra.
<P>
Some associations tie many objects in a class to one object of
another class.  For example, there can be many lines measured in one
spectrum.  The parameter <TT>measured</TT> in the <TT>SpecObj</TT> class has
the type <TT>ManyAssoc(SpecLine)</TT>.  The following <EM>Association Query</EM>
returns parameters for all of the lines of the selected spectrum:
<PRE>SELECT name.name,wave,ew FROM
(SELECT measured FROM SpecObj WHERE
	plate.plateID == 384 &amp;&amp; fiberID == 284)</PRE>
<P>
The online user's guide to the SDSS Query tool contains a detailed
description of the language, examples to help construct advanced queries,
and details about macros to perform logical and arithmetic operations
within queries.
