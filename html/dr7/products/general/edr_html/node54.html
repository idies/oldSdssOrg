Images of quasars are characterized in the optical by high luminosity
and very high surface brightness, making them morphologically
indistinguishable from stars at all but very low redshifts (<IMG WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3415" SRC="img150.gif"> at the resolution of the SDSS).  Quasar spectra, however, are
characterized by roughly power-law continua and strong emission lines; as a
result, quasar spectra are quite distinct from the roughly black-body
spectra of stars.
<P>
The dominance of the continuum on the colors of quasars is
severely reduced because of absorption by the Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> forest and
Lyman-limit systems (at rest wavelengths below <IMG WIDTH=33 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3419" SRC="img152.gif">&#197;&nbsp; and
<IMG WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3421" SRC="img153.gif">&#197;, respectively).  For the SDSS filter set, absorption
by the Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> forest is significant for <IMG WIDTH=52 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3425" SRC="img154.gif">, and quasars
become increasingly red with larger redshift
fan99a,richards01a.  Fortunately, this effect also gives
quasars colors that are distinctly different from those of normal
stars.
<P>
Models of quasars by fan99a show that the quasar locus is
indeed well-separated from the stellar locus except at <I>z</I> = 2.7-2.8,
where quasars have SDSS broad-band colors that are essentially
indistinguishable from early F and late A stars.  Thus the majority of
quasars have colors quite distinct from those of stars, which, unlike
quasars, lie on a nearly one-dimensional locus in
<IMG WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3429" SRC="img155.gif"> color-color-color-color
space newberg97, fan99a, finlator00.  Using this property, we
identify quasar candidates primarily as outliers from the stellar
locus in this 4-color space.  This algorithm is described in more
detail by richards01b.
<P>
The quasar target selection algorithm first models the stellar locus,
following newberg97, as an elongated tube with an elliptical
cross-section.  In practice, this is done in two stages, once for the
<IMG WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3431" SRC="img156.gif"> color cube, and once for the <IMG WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3433" SRC="img157.gif"> color cube.  The PSF colors of each object are examined
in turn, and it is determined whether they are consistent with lying inside
the stellar locus, incorporating the photometric errors. The
quoted errors in PSF magnitudes from <TT>frames</TT> are used, after adding
<IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2799" SRC="img3.gif"> 0.03 mag errors in quadrature in each color to reflect the
uncertainty in the photometric calibration.  Quasar candidates are
those objects which lie more than <IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3437" SRC="img158.gif"> from the stellar locus.  Colors are
measured using PSF magnitudes, and are corrected for reddening using 
schlegel98 throughout.
<P>
The quantity <TT>objFlags</TT> in class <TT>photoObj</TT> uses the bitmasks in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A> to indicate objects whose photometry (and therefore,
colors) may be in error.  In particular, we reject objects flagged as <TT>
BLENDED</TT> (although we accept the deblended children of blended parents), <TT>
BRIGHT</TT>, <TT>SATURATED</TT>, or <TT>EDGE</TT> in any band.  Objects detected as <TT>
MOVING</TT> at a rate greater than 0.2 pixels per frame with high significance are
rejected as asteroids (although this rejection is no longer needed in the
current algorithm; asteroids have colors that put them cleanly in the stellar
locus; ivezic01).  Deblended children with <TT>PEAKCENTER</TT>, <TT>
NOTCHECKED</TT>, or <TT>DEBLEND_NOPEAK</TT> set in any band are signs of deblending
problems; these objects are also rejected.  Objects with <TT>INTERP_CENTER</TT>
set have a cosmic ray or bad column within 3 pixels of their center;
empirically, we find that many false quasar candidates are found with <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3439" SRC="img159.gif"> and this flag set, so we reject all such objects.  There are a few bad
columns which are not properly interpolated over by the photometric pipeline,
and so we reject objects in CCD columns 1019-1031 in <TT>camCol</TT> 5.
<P>
Main Quasar Sample
<P>
At one point, we had considered separate
criteria in regions of high and low stellar density, as we were concerned
about changing stellar populations at low latitudes.  For this reason, objects
that pass the main quasar target selection criteria have the <TT>
TARGET_QSO_CAP</TT> (referring to the Galactic cap) or <TT>TARGET_QSO_SKIRT</TT>
(the ring around Galactic cap region), target mask bit set in <TT>
primTarget</TT> of class <TT>specObj</TT>, depending on their
Galactic coordinates and, in particular, the estimated stellar density from
the bahcall80 model.  However, we
found that the effectiveness of the algorithm was independent of stellar
density, so the selection of the two is identical.
<P>
An outlier from the <IMG WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3431" SRC="img156.gif"> color cube is a
quasar candidate if it passes the above gauntlet of tests and has
<IMG WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3443" SRC="img160.gif">.  The bright limit is set to avoid problems with
cross-talk in the spectrographs.  As indicated in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbltargetcriteria">29</A>, the bright limit used for <TT>
target</TT> version v2.2.a, runs 752 and 756 was <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3445" SRC="img161.gif">.  The object
need not be stellar if it lies blueward of the main galaxy locus; this
allows low-redshift AGN, whose host galaxy is visible, to be selected.
<P>
We reject some quasar candidates if they have colors that match known types of
stars which lie outside the main stellar locus.   In particular,  hot
white dwarfs are excluded when 
 - and
<BR><A NAME="rejectwd">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=653 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation1132" SRC="img162.gif"><BR>
unresolved M dwarf-white dwarf pairs are excluded when
<BR><A NAME="rejectmdwd">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=535 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation1135" SRC="img163.gif"><BR>
and A stars are excluded when
<BR><A NAME="rejecta">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=549 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation1138" SRC="img164.gif"><BR>
<P>
The quasar locus crosses the stellar locus for quasars of <IMG WIDTH=53 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3447" SRC="img165.gif">, so 
we <EM>include</EM> target objects when
<BR><A NAME="rejectbluehiz">&#160;</A><IMG WIDTH=539 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation1142" SRC="img166.gif"><BR>
even if they are not outliers from the stellar locus.
<P>
Each of these three regimes of stars were rejected in the EDR data (as
indicated in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbltargetcriteria">29</A>), except with <TT>
target</TT> version v2.2a, runs 752 and 756, when only the A star
rejection was applied.  Inclusion of objects in the region where the
stellar and quasar loci cross was performed for all three versions of
<TT>target</TT> used for the EDR.
<P>
The SDSS catalog is matched against the FIRST catalog of radio sources
becker95, and stellar objects with radio counterparts within
<IMG WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3449" SRC="img167.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3451" SRC="img168.gif"> are selected, using the mask bit <TT>
TARGET_QSO_FIRST_CAP</TT> or <TT>TARGET_QSO_FIRST_SKIRT</TT> depending on their
position on the sky.
<P>
High Redshift Quasar Sample
<P>
The mask bit in <TT>primTarget</TT> we use for the high
redshift quasar sample is <TT>TARGET_QSO_HIZ</TT>.  Outliers from the stellar
locus in the <IMG WIDTH=209 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3433" SRC="img157.gif"> color cube with <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3455" SRC="img169.gif">
are selected, subject to the rejection criteria given above in  
equations&nbsp;<A HREF="node54.html#rejectwd">20</A>,&nbsp;<A HREF="node54.html#rejectmdwd">21</A>, and&nbsp;<A HREF="node54.html#rejecta">22</A>.
Additionally, candidates must be classified as stellar, as they will have
redshifts above <I>z</I> = 3.5 for the most part (see the discussion in Fan et
al.&nbsp;2001a).  For <TT>target</TT> versions v2.5 and v2.7, we also targeted
objects which lie in the region of color-color space for <I>z</I> &gt; 3,  are
still outliers in the <IMG WIDTH=213 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3431" SRC="img156.gif"> cube and have <IMG WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3463" SRC="img170.gif"> and <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3455" SRC="img169.gif">, see Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbltargetcriteria">29</A>.
<P>
Although low-redshift quasars manifest themselves most dramatically as
outliers in <IMG WIDTH=54 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3467" SRC="img171.gif">, they are also outliers in the <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3469" SRC="img172.gif"> color
cube, and would thus dominate the (nominally) high-redshift color cut, which
goes fainter than the main quasar sample.  Therefore, we rejected very blue
objects that satisfy
<BR><IMG WIDTH=552 HEIGHT=17 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="eqnarray1159" SRC="img173.gif"><BR>
even if they were outliers in the <IMG WIDTH=61 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3469" SRC="img172.gif"> color cube.
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbltargetcriteria">29</A> indicates that this rejection was not done in
<TT>target</TT> v2.2.a.
<P>
Faint, Reject, and Magnitude Outlier Objects
<P>
For <TT>target</TT> versions v2.2.a, v2.5, and v2.7, objects which lie outside
the stellar locus, but are fainter than the magnitude limit, are flagged as
<TT>TARGET_QSO_FAINT</TT>; they are not targeted, but are marked as being of
potential interest.  We emphasize, however, that the algorithm is not
optimized fainter than <IMG WIDTH=67 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3473" SRC="img174.gif">, so the fraction of objects flagged as <TT>
TARGET_QSO_FAINT</TT> that turn out to be quasars will decrease significantly
with magnitude.  Objects with this flag set will only have spectra if
they were targeted by another module.
<P>
Performance of Quasar Target Selection
<P>
Quasar candidates are selected primarily as objects with colors distinct from
stars, allowing the serendipitous discovery of a variety of objects of unusual
color, including those that do not conform to ``standard'' quasar colors.  It
has thus found a number of very unusual BAL quasars, extreme emission-line
galaxies, high-redshift (<I>z</I> &gt; 0.7) starburst and post-starburst galaxies, and
a handful of objects whose spectra defy classification.
<P>
This algorithm selects of order 15 objects per square degree.  Our
target efficiency requirement is that at least 65% of our quasar
candidates should in fact be quasars.  The EDR is very close to
meeting this requirement, and we certainly expect future data releases
to meet or exceed this requirement.  The principal contaminants are
compact blue star-forming galaxies at low redshift; A stars; white
dwarfs and M dwarf-white dwarf pairs that the above color cuts don't
completely remove; and a variety of exotica such as <I>z</I> &gt; 0.4 compact
E+A galaxies, whose Balmer break gives them colors very similar to 
<I>z</I>=4 quasars.  Comparison with quasars from the literature shows that
our completeness is of order 90%, which is consistent with our
completeness requirement.  Known quasars that are not targeted are
rejected for a wide variety of reasons: many are due to cosmetic
defects, and many <I>z</I>=3.5 and <I>z</I>=4.5 quasars are missing due to
problems with the quasar target selection code, which have been corrected
since <TT>target</TT> was run to define the plates in the EDR.
