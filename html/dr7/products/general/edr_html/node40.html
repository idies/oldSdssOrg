Main-belt asteroids have a proper motion of several arcsec in the roughly 5
minutes it takes for an object to cross the imaging camera.  This means that
they will have a different centroid in the different photometric bands.  If
not taken into account, this could mean that they would be deblended into
separate objects of unusual color, playing havoc with the target selection
algorithms (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node51.html#swtarget">4.8</A>).  Thus the deblender checks every object for
consistency with uniform proper motion between the filters.  In the <TT>
PhotoObj</TT> class (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblphoto">6</A>) the quantities <TT>colv</TT> and <TT>
rowv</TT> (and their associated errors), give the resulting proper motion (along
the columns and rows of the CCDs respectively) in units of degrees per day.
The PSF photometry in each band is done on the object center, taking the
motion into account, and therefore is properly measured
ivezic01.
<P>
Flag bit values listed in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A> describe this
processing.  The <TT>MOVED</TT> flag indicates that the deblender
considered whether to deblend the object as moving; it is not very
useful.  If the deblender actually deblended the object as moving, the
flag <TT>DEBLENDED_AS_MOVING</TT> is set; otherwise the flag <TT>
NODEBLEND_MOVING</TT> is set.  Note that an object can have a
statistically significant motion without being deblended as such if
the motion is small enough that the photometry would be fine without
taking it into account.  An object whose motion is not statistically
significant is flagged <TT>STATIONARY</TT>, while an object whose motion
is inconsistent with a straight line is flagged <TT>
BAD_MOVING_FIT</TT>.
