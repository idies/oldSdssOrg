For each stripe, 12 non-overlapping but contiguous scan lines are
defined parallel to the stripe great circle.  Six of these scan lines
are covered when the ``north'' strip of the stripe is scanned, and the
remaining six are covered by the ``south'' strip.  Each scan line is
<IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3343" SRC="img136.gif"> wide and overlaps its neighbor by <IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2799" SRC="img3.gif"> 1&nbsp;arcmin.
Each overlap region is bisected by a line of constant <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2951" SRC="img48.gif">.  Objects
in overlap regions can have a detection in each of the scan lines, and
we assign one of the scan lines to have the <EM>primary detection</EM>
based upon which side of the bisecting line it falls.  Many queries
want to consider only these objects, so we have constructed the 
<TT>Primary</TT> class in the catalog archive server.  The classes <TT>
Star</TT>, <TT>Galaxy</TT>, <TT>Sky</TT>, and <TT>Unknown</TT> are inherited from
<TT>Primary</TT>.  Other object detections are (usually) in the <TT>
Secondary</TT> class, with its inherited classes <TT>StarSecondary</TT>, <TT>
GalaxySecondary</TT>, <TT>SkySecondary</TT>, and <TT>UnknownSecondary</TT>.  Two
kinds of objects are not in the <TT>Primary</TT> or <TT>Secondary</TT>
classes, and we put them in the <TT>Family</TT> class: objects which are
tagged as <TT>BRIGHT</TT> (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A>); and parent objects
which have been successfully deblended.
<P>
Object detections in
the area that overlaps adjacent stripes which we have not yet observed are in
the <TT>Secondary</TT> class.  These may be recovered by using the <TT>status</TT>
flag in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblphoto">6</A>.  The flag bits <TT>AR_STATUS_OK_SCANLINE</TT>
and <TT>AR_STATUS_OK_STRIPE</TT> of <TT>status</TT> are set for all objects that
are within one stripe.
<P>
Objects that lie close to the bisector between scan lines present some
difficulty.  Errors in the centroids or astrometric calibrations can place
such objects on either side of the bisector.  A resolution is performed at all
bisectors, and if two objects which are a <EM>primary detection</EM> lie within
2&nbsp;arcsec of each other, then one object is declared primary and the other
secondary.
<P>
In the EDR, most data are taken along stripes that are isolated.  Runs 752 and
756 cover stripe 10, and we plan to observe the stripes adjacent to it.
Therefore, only objects which do not fall in an area that will overlap with
the adjacent stripes may be marked as <TT>Primary</TT> detections.  Runs 94 and
125 cover stripe 82, in the southern Galactic hemisphere.  We do not plan to
observe the stripes adjacent to stripe 82, so all objects may be marked as
<TT>Primary</TT> detections.
<P>
Objects must satisfy other criteria as well to be labeled primary; an object
must not be flagged <TT>BRIGHT</TT> (as there is a duplicate ``regular''
detection of the same object; &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#swphotoprocedure">4.4.2</A>), and must not be a
deblended parent (as the children are already included); thus it must not be
flagged <TT>BLENDED</TT> unless the <TT>NODEBLEND</TT> flag is set.  These are put
in the <TT>Family</TT> class.
<P>
The set of all <EM>primary detections</EM> from interleaving strips
comprise a complete object catalog.
