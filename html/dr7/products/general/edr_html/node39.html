Once objects are detected, they are deblended by identifying
individual peaks within each object, merging the list of peaks across
bands, and adaptively determining the profile of images associated
with each peak, which sum to form the original image in each band. The
originally detected object is referred to as the ``parent'' object and
has the flag <TT>BLENDED</TT> set if multiple peaks are detected; the
final set of sub-images of which the parent consists are referred to
as the ``children'' and have the flag <TT>CHILD</TT> set. Note that all
quantities in class <TT>PhotoObj</TT> (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblphoto">6</A>) are
measured for <EM>both</EM> parent and child.  For each child, <TT>parent</TT> gives the <TT>id</TT> of the parent (for parents
themselves or isolated objects, this is set to the <TT>id</TT> of the
<TT>BRIGHT</TT> counterpart if that exists; otherwise it is set to -1);
for each parent, <TT>nchild</TT> gives the number of children an object
has.  Children are assigned the <TT>id</TT> numbers immediately after the
<TT>id</TT> number of the parent. Thus, if object with <TT>id</TT> 23 is set
as <TT>BLENDED</TT> and has <TT>nchild</TT> equal to 2, objects 24 and 25
will be set as <TT>CHILD</TT> and have <TT>parent</TT> equal to 23.
<P>
The list of peaks in the parent is trimmed to combine peaks (from
different bands) that are too close to each other (if this happens,
the flag <TT>
PEAKS_TOO_CLOSE</TT> is set in the parent).  If there are more than 25
peaks, only the most significant are kept, and the flag <TT>
DEBLEND_TOO_MANY_PEAKS</TT> is set in the parent.
<P>
In a number of situations, 
the deblender decides not to process a <TT>BLENDED</TT> object; in this
case the object is flagged as <TT>NODEBLEND</TT>. Most objects with <TT>
EDGE</TT> set are not deblended. The exceptions are when the object is big
enough (larger than roughly an arcminute) that it will most likely not be completely included in the
adjacent scanline either; in this case, <TT>DEBLENDED_AT_EDGE</TT> is
set, and the deblender gives it its best shot. When an object is
larger than half a frame, the deblender also gives up, and the object
is flagged as <TT>TOO_LARGE</TT>. Other intricacies of the deblending
results are recorded in flags listed in Table <A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A>; see lupton01b for a complete description.
<P>
On average, about 15-20% of all detected objects are blended, and many of these
are superpositions of galaxies which the deblender successfully treats
by separating the images of the nearby objects. Thus, usually it is
the childless (not <TT>BLENDED</TT>) objects which are of most interest
for science applications. However, the versions of the pipelines
used for the EDR occasionally deblends complex galaxies with large
angular size, such as nearby face-on spiral galaxies, in a way which
the human eye would tend not to. Thus, some care is required in the
analysis of samples of bright and/or large objects in the survey. 
Later versions of the deblender handle these cases much more
gracefully, and future data releases will incorporate these
improvements.
