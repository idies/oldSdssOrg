The pipeline analyzes the data one field (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node29.html#hwda">3.5</A>) at a time. Because
information about each object is contained in five separate frames,
one for each filter, the five frames for each field are processed
together.
<P>
Each frame has instrumental signatures (flat field, bias, cosmic rays,
and bad columns) removed, and the global sky value from the <TT>psp</TT>
subtracted.  The CCDs are known to be non-linear by of order 2% near
saturation; this is <EM>not</EM> corrected for in the current version of
the pipeline.  Cosmic rays are found as objects with gradients between
adjacent pixels substantially steeper than allowed by the PSF and are
interpolated over.  Note that our images are marginally well-sampled
in 1'' seeing.  Previously recognized bad columns are interpolated
over using linear prediction (e.g., Rybicki &amp; Press 1992), as are
bleed trails from saturated stars.
<P>
Objects containing a (found and interpolated-over) cosmic ray
are flagged by having the mask bit <TT>CR</TT> set in <TT>flags</TT> for
that band; objects with any interpolated pixels in them at all (due to
bad columns or bleed trails) are flagged by having <TT>INTERP</TT> set.
<TT>INTERP_CENTER</TT> indicates that a pixel was interpolated over
within 3 pixels of the center of the object, and <TT>
PSF_FLUX_INTERP</TT> indicates that at least 20% of the PSF flux is
interpolated; in rare cases, photometry of objects with these latter
two flags set might be suspect.
<P>
Next, objects in the frame are detected and their properties measured
in a four step process in each band.  First, an object finder is run
to detect bright objects. In each band, the object-finder detects
pixels which are more than <IMG WIDTH=35 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3047" SRC="img64.gif"> (corresponding roughly to <IMG WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3049" SRC="img65.gif">) above the sky noise; only a single pixel need be over this
threshold for an object to be detected at this stage.  These objects are flagged as
<TT>BRIGHT</TT>.  The extended power-law wings of <TT>BRIGHT</TT> objects
which are saturated are subtracted from the frame.  Such stars are
marked <TT>SUBTRACTED</TT>.  Then, the sky level is estimated by
median-smoothing the frame image on a scale of approximately
100&nbsp;arcsec; the resulting ``local'' sky image is subtracted from the
frame (remember that a global sky determined on an entire frame has
already been subtracted).  This sky level is stored for each object
for each band in the parameter <TT>sky</TT> (and an associated
uncertainty <TT>skyErr</TT>), in units of asinh magnitudes
(&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node41.html#swphotoluptitudes">4.4.5</A>) per square arcsec. 
For children of
blends (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node39.html#swphotodeblend">4.4.3</A>), the <TT>sky</TT> parameter includes
the contribution of its siblings.
<P>
Third, we find objects by smoothing the image with a Gaussian fit to
the PSF, and look for <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3051" SRC="img66.gif"> peaks over the (smoothed) sky in each band.
After objects are detected, they are ``grown'' more-or-less
isotropically by an amount approximately equal to the radius of the
seeing disk. We then define an object to be a connected set of pixels
which are detected in at least one band.  Note that all pixels in the
object are subsequently used in the analysis in <I>every</I> band,
whether or not they were originally detected in that band.  The
photometric pipeline never reports an upper limit for the detection of
an object, but rather carries out a proper measurement, with its
error, for each of the varieties of fluxes listed in
&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node41.html#swphotoflux">4.4.5</A>.
<P>
Objects detected in a given band at this stage are flagged by setting the mask
bit <TT>BINNED1</TT> (Table &nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A>) in <TT>flags</TT> of the <TT>PhotoObj</TT>
class in that band. All pixel values in these <TT>BINNED1</TT> objects are then
replaced by the background level (with sky noise added in), the frame is
rebinned into a <IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3053" SRC="img67.gif"> image, and the object-finder is run again. The
resulting sample is flagged in a similar way with the <TT>BINNED2</TT> mask, and
pixel values in these objects are replaced with the background level.
Finally, we rebin the original pixel data at <IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=22 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2839" SRC="img13.gif">, and objects found at
this stage are flagged <TT>BINNED4</TT>. The set of detected objects then
consists of all objects with pixels flagged <TT>BINNED1</TT>, <TT>BINNED2</TT>, or
<TT>BINNED4</TT>.
<P>
Fourth, the pipeline measures the properties of each object, including
the position, as well as several measures of flux and shape, described
more fully below. It attempts to determine whether each object actually
consists of more than one object projected on the sky, and if so, to
deblend such a ``parent'' object into its constituent ``children'',
self-consistently across the bands (thus all children have
measurements in all bands).  Then it again measures the properties of
these individual children.  Bright objects are measured twice: once
with a global sky, and no deblending run; this detection is flagged
<TT>BRIGHT</TT>, and a second time with a local sky.  For most purposes,
only the latter is useful, and thus one should reject all objects
flagged <TT>BRIGHT</TT> in compiling a sample of objects for study.
<P>
Other flag bits listed in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblflag">9</A> that are useful at this stage
are:
<UL>
<LI>  <TT>SATUR</TT>, indicating
that at least one pixel in the object is flagged as saturated (the
corresponding <TT>SATUR_CENTER</TT> indicates that the saturated
pixel(s) are close to the center, to distinguish extended objects
blended with saturated stars on their outskirts; unfortunately,
this distinction is not as clean as we would like, due to
improper handling of diffraction spikes).
<LI> <TT>EDGE</TT>, indicating that the object overlaps the edge of the
frame, which may affect the photometry of the object. 
</UL>
<P>
Finally, the pipeline outputs the measured quantities for each object,
including all of the <TT>BRIGHT</TT> objects, all the parents, and all
the children. In the following sections, we discuss how to interpret these 
outputs.
<P>
A typical frame at high Galactic latitudes contains of order 1000
objects, including of order 5 objects chosen deliberately in regions
where no objects are detected; these are used to place sky fibers for
spectroscopy, and are classified as <TT>Sky</TT>.  Repeat observations of a given area of sky in roughly
1.5'' seeing shows that our 95% completeness limit for stars is
<IMG WIDTH=303 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3059" SRC="img68.gif">, and <IMG WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3061" SRC="img69.gif">; the
completeness drops to zero over roughly half a magnitude.  These
numbers are somewhat worse than quoted in the SDSS Project Book
york00, as that calculation assumed 1'' seeing and slightly
broader filters.
