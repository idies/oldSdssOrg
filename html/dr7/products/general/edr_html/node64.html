We encourage the active use of these data from the SDSS EDR.
We have worked to make the data products as accurate as
possible, but realize that some calibration or cataloging errors may
have crept into our work.  Feedback to the help desk set up at the
STScI will allow us to evaluate the usefulness and correctness of
these catalogs.  As appropriate, we will update the calibration and
contents of this early data release and announce these changes on the
users' group mailing list and the SDSS web site.
<P>
The next data release of SDSS data is scheduled for January of 2003.
It is scheduled to include at least 1,500 square degrees of imaging
data and corresponding spectra.
<P>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a joint project of The
University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the
Japan Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins University, the
Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), the Max-Planck-Institute
for Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State University, Princeton
University, the United States Naval Observatory, and the University of
Washington. Apache Point Observatory, site of the SDSS telescopes, is
operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC).
<P>
Funding for the project has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the SDSS member institutions, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Department of Energy, the Japanese Monbukagakusho, and the Max
Planck Society. The SDSS Web site is http://www.sdss.org/.
