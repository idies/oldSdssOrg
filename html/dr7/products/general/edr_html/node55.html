A variety of other science targets are selected.  These include
optical counterparts of ROSAT sources, stars, and
serendipitous targets.  These samples are not complete (with the
exception of spectrophotometric standards and brown dwarfs), but are
assigned to excess fibers left over after the main samples of galaxies,
LRG's, and quasars are tiled (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node58.html#swplate">4.9</A>).
<P>
ROSAT Targets
<P>
For typical values of the ratio of optical to X-ray flux of various
classes of Galactic and extragalactic sources, there is an excellent
match between the depth of SDSS in the optical 
and that of the ROSAT All Sky Survey (RASS; voges99)
in X-rays.  Objects detected in SDSS imaging data are positionally
matched against X-ray sources from the RASS catalogs. SDSS objects
within the RASS positional error circles (commonly 10-20'' radius)
are scrutinized further by target selection algorithms tuned to select
likely optical counterparts to the X-ray sources. 
In decreasing priority order, spectra are obtained for
SDSS/RASS coincidences that: (a) are also radio sources (flagged <TT>ROSAT_A</TT>); (b) have SDSS
optical colors of AGN/quasars (<TT>ROSAT_B</TT>); (c) fall in a broad intermediate
priority bin that includes bright and/or moderately blue stars and
galaxies (<TT>ROSAT_C</TT>); (d) are otherwise bright enough for
follow-up spectroscopy (<TT>ROSAT_D</TT>).  Objects flagged <TT>
ROSAT_E</TT> are not targeted; they fall within the ROSAT error circle,
but are either too faint or too bright for our spectrographs.  Objects
with fiber magnitude brighter than 15 in
<IMG WIDTH=15 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2829" SRC="img10.gif">, <IMG WIDTH=14 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2863" SRC="img21.gif">, or <IMG WIDTH=12 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3201" SRC="img110.gif"> are not targeted, because of cross-talk
between fibers in the spectrograph.
<P>
This algorithm targets of order 10-15 objects per plate; over half are
AGN or quasars.
<P>
Stars
<P>
A variety of stars are also targeted by their distinctive colors.
Specific stellar spectroscopic target categories include blue
horizontal branch stars (flagged <TT>STAR_BHB</TT>), carbon stars, both
dwarf and giant (<TT>
STAR_CARBON</TT>), low-luminosity subdwarfs (<TT>STAR_SUB_DWARF</TT>), the
central stars of planetary nebulae (<TT>STAR_PN</TT>), cataclysmic
variables (<TT>CATY_VAR</TT>), red and
brown dwarfs (<TT>STAR_RED_DWARF</TT> and <TT>STAR_BROWN_DWARF</TT>),
and hot white dwarfs (<TT>STAR_WHITE_DWARF</TT>).  The planetary
nebula and cataclysmic variable categories are essentially completely
contained within the quasar target selection region of color-color
space, and are much rarer than quasars; only a handful of these
objects have been found.   The definition of red dwarf was too
inclusive in the version of <TT>target</TT> used, resulting in the
observations of a large number
of ordinary M dwarfs.  The brown dwarfs are very rare (typically
one every several plates); unlike the other categories of stars, these
are tiled.  However, in the
EDR data, the algorithm for selecting these objects was modified
several times, making the formal definition of a complete sample
difficult.
<P>
Additionally, of order 30% of the objects targeted as quasars
turn out, in fact, to be stars, for the most part outliers from the
stellar locus by definition (but occasionally objects in the stellar
locus as well, due to early errors in the code).  This is of course
not a complete sample, but it contains several thousand spectra of
uniform data quality of stars of all spectral types.
<P>
Serendipity Targets
<P>
Finally, we have an open category of targets, referred to as <EM>
serendipity</EM>, whose criteria are subject to change as different
regions of parameter space are explored.  There are several categories
of these in the EDR.  These are flagged as <TT>
SERENDIP_RED</TT>, <TT>SERENDIP_BLUE</TT>, and <TT>SERENDIP_DISTANT</TT> for
objects lying outside the stellar locus in color space (the latter
refers to distance 
from the stellar locus).  These overlap somewhat with the quasar and
some of the stellar target selection categories.  Objects coincident
with FIRST radio sources are flagged <TT>SERENDIP_FIRST</TT>; this
matching goes fainter than the equivalent for quasar target selection,
and has no restriction on stellarity.  Finally, <TT>SERENDIP_MANUAL</TT>
targets are selected by hand, as the name implies. 
A wide variety of
interesting objects have emerged from serendipity spectroscopic
targets, ranging from highly unusual categories of white dwarfs to
radio-loud broad absorption line quasars menou01.
