As mentioned above, the data stream from each CCD is divided into an
overlapping series of <IMG WIDTH=77 HEIGHT=28 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3031" SRC="img59.gif"> frames, for ease of
processing; the <TT>frames</TT> pipeline (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node36.html#swphoto">4.4</A>) will process
these separately.  However, in order to ensure continuity along the
data stream, certain quantities need to be determined on timescales up
to the length of the imaging run.  The astrometric and photometric
calibrations certainly fall into that category; in addition, the
Postage Stamp Pipeline (<TT>psp</TT>) calculates a global sky for a
field, flatfield vector, bias level, and the point-spread function
(PSF).
<P>
Even in the absence of atmospheric inhomogeneities, the SDSS telescope
delivers images whose FWHMs vary by up to 15% from one side of a CCD
to the other; the worst effects are seen in the chips furthest from
the optical axis.  Moreover, since the atmospheric seeing varies with
time, the delivered image quality is a complex two-dimensional
function even on the scale of a single frame.  
An example of the instantaneous image quality across the imaging
camera is shown in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figpsfmosaic">7</A>, where each rectangle
represents one chip<A NAME="tex2html10" HREF="footnode.html#508"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="../../../images/foot_motif.gif"></A>.
<P>
The description of the point spread function (PSF) is critical for
accurate PSF photometry, for star/galaxy separation, and for unbiased
measures of the shapes of non-stellar objects; we need to map the full
variation of the PSF even on scales of a single frame.  The SDSS
imaging PSF is modeled heuristically in each band using a
Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve (KL) transform adass.  In particular, using
stars brighter than roughly 20th magnitude, we expand the PSF from a
series of five frames into eigen-images, and keep the first three
terms.  We fit the variation of the coefficients multiplying these
terms to second order in position across the chip, using data from the
frame in question, plus the immediately preceding and following
half-frames.
<P>
The success of this KL expansion is gauged by comparing PSF photometry
based on the modeled KL PSFs to large aperture photometry for the same (bright)
stars. The width of the distribution of these differences is typically 1% or
less, which is thus an upper limit on the accuracy of the PSF
photometry (not including calibration problems; see &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node44.html#swphotocal">4.5</A>).
Without accounting for the spatial variation of the PSF across the image, the
photometric errors would be as high as 15%.  We have recently found
a subtle dependence of the PSF width on stellar color in the <I>g</I> band;
this affects PSF photometry at the <IMG WIDTH=40 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3035" SRC="img60.gif"> level, and will be addressed
in future data releases.
<P>
Parameters that characterize one frame of imaging data are stored in the class
<TT>Field</TT> (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbladministrativefield">16</A>).  The <TT>status</TT>
parameter flag for each frame indicates the success of the KL decomposition;
its possible values are given in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tbladministrativefield">16</A>.  In
particular, if the data do not support the fitting of a second-order term to
the variation of the coefficients with position, a linear fit is carried out,
and <TT>status</TT> is set to 1.  If even this is not warranted by the data, the
coefficients are set to be constants, and the <TT>status</TT> flag is set to 2.
Finally, if no PSF stars are available at all, the PSF model is set to that of
the previous frame, and <TT>status</TT> = 3.  A more quantitative measure of the
accuracy of the PSF fit on a given frame is given by the scatter in the
difference between PSF magnitudes and aperture magnitudes, as reported in <TT>
psfApCorrectionErr</TT>.  Note that the actual KL values and the eigenshapes are
not reported in the tables, so the shape of the PSF as a function of position
within a CCD cannot be reconstructed based on the parameters included in this
EDR.
<P>
The <TT>psp</TT> returns various measures of the PSF shape in addition to the KL
decomposition, including parameters of the best-fit double-Gaussian, evaluated
at the center of each frame.  These are the <TT>psf2GSigma</TT> parameters in the
<TT>Field</TT> class. The <TT>psfWidth</TT> is is the effective width also
determined at the center of each frame.   It is a good generic number to quote
for the seeing on each frame.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figSeeing">8</A> shows the <TT>
psfWidth</TT> in <I>r</I> for each CCD column in each run of the EDR imaging data.
Improvements in telescope collimation and thermal environment since these data
were taken have given rise to substantially better seeing.
<P>
The <TT>psp</TT> calculates a PSF aperture correction for each field.  We
did not fully test this correction and did not properly apply it to
the EDR.  The quantity <TT>apCorrRunErr</TT> is the median value of the
difference between <TT>psfMag</TT> and the aperture magnitude measured
with a 7.43<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=7 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3039" SRC="img61.gif"> radius aperture over the bright stars in the
frame, and is a measure of the limitations of our KL decomposition of
the PSF.  This quantity is Gaussian-distributed with <IMG WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3041" SRC="img62.gif"> mag, but <TT>apCorrRunErr</TT> can be as large as 0.1 mag in
regions that the PSF is changing rapidly (FWHM changing by <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3043" SRC="img63.gif"> on
a single frame); adding it directly to the <TT>psfMag</TT> in the EDR
improves the overall PSF photometry accordingly.  This correction will
be applied to the data correctly in future data releases of the SDSS
data.  <TT>apCorrRunErr</TT> is shown for each run in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#figacre">9</A>, and we provide a table of these corrections on
our web site.
