<A NAME="swspectro1d">&#160;</A>
<P>
The <TT>spectro1d</TT> pipeline analyzes the combined, merged spectra
output by <TT>spectro2d</TT> and determines object classifications 
(galaxy, quasar, star, or unknown) and redshifts; it also provides 
various line measurements and warning flags.
<P>
The code attempts to measure an emission and absorption
redshift independently for every targeted (non-sky) object. That is,
to avoid biases, the absorption and emission codes operate
independently, and they both operate independently of any target selection
information.
<P>
The <TT>spectro1d</TT> pipeline performs a sequence of tasks for 
each object spectrum on a plate: The spectrum and error array are read in, along 
with the pixel mask. Pixels with mask bits set to <TT>FULLREJECT,
NOSKY, NODATA</TT>, or <TT>BRIGHTSKY</TT> are given no weight in the
<TT>spectro1d</TT> routines.  The continuum is then fit with  a 5th order polynomial, 
 with iterative rejection of outliers (e.g., strong
lines). The fit continuum is subtracted from the spectrum. 
The continuum-subtracted spectra are used for cross-correlating 
with the stellar templates.
<P>
Emission Line Redshifts
<P>
Emission lines (peaks in the 1d spectrum) are found by carrying out a
wavelet transform of the
continuum-subtracted spectrum <IMG WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3535" SRC="img183.gif">:
<BR><IMG WIDTH=525 HEIGHT=43 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="equation1281" SRC="img184.gif"><BR>
where <I>g</I>(<I>x</I>;<I>a</I>,<I>b</I>) is the wavelet (with complex conjugate <IMG WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=23 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3539" SRC="img185.gif">) with
translation and scale parameters <I>a</I>, <I>b</I>. We apply the
<EM>&#224; trous</EM> wavelet stark97.
For fixed wavelet scale <I>b</I>, the wavelet transform is computed at
each pixel center <I>a</I>; the scale <I>b</I> is then increased in
geometric steps and the process repeated. Once the full wavelet
transform is computed, the code finds peaks above a threshold and
eliminates multiple detections (at different <I>b</I>) of a given line
by searching nearby pixels. The output of this routine is a set of
positions of candidate emission lines.
<P>
This list of lines with non-zero weights is matched against a list of
common galaxy and quasar emission lines given in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblreflines">30</A>, many of which were measured from the
composite quasar spectrum of vandenberk01 (due to velocity
shifts of different lines in quasars, the wavelengths listed don't
necessarily match their rest-frame values). Each significant peak found by the wavelet
routine is assigned a trial line identification from the common list
(e.g., Mg2) and an associated trial redshift. The peak is fit
with a Gaussian, and the line center, width, and height above the
continuum are stored in the <TT>SpecLine</TT> class as parameters <TT>wave</TT>,
<TT>sigma</TT>, and <TT>height</TT>, respectively.  If the code detects
close neighboring lines, it fits them with multiple
Gaussians. Depending on the trial line identification, the linewidth
it tries to fit is physically constrained. The code then searches for
the other expected common emission lines at the appropriate
wavelengths for that trial redshift and computes a Confidence Level
(<I>CL</I>) by summing over the weights of the found lines and dividing by
the summed weights of the expected lines. The <I>CL</I> is penalized if the
different line centers do not quite match.  Once all the trial line
identifications/redshifts have been explored, an emission line
redshift is chosen as the one with the highest <I>CL</I>,
and stored as <TT>z</TT> in the <TT>EmissionRedshift</TT> class.  The exact
expression for the emission line <I>CL</I> has been tweaked to match our
empirical success rate in assigning correct emission line redshifts,
based on manual inspection of a large number of spectra from the 
EDR (&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#swspectrotest">4.10.3</A>).
<P>
The <TT>SpecLine</TT> class also gives the errors, continuum, equivalent width,
<IMG WIDTH=17 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3143" SRC="img97.gif">, spectral index, and significance of each line, in parameters listed
in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecinfo">12</A>.  We caution that the emission line measurement for
H<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> should only be used if <IMG WIDTH=78 HEIGHT=32 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3563" SRC="img186.gif">.  In the <TT>SpecLine</TT>
class, ``found'' lines denote only those lines used to measure the emission
line redshift, while ``measured'' lines are all lines in the emission line
list (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblreflines">30</A>) measured at the redshifted positions
appropriate to the final redshift assigned to the object.
<P>
A separate routine searches for high-redshift (<I>z</I>&gt;2.3) quasars by
identifying spectra that contain a Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> forest signature: a
broad emission line with more fluctuation on the blue side than on the
red side of the line.  The routine outputs the wavelength of the
Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> emission line; while this allows a determination of the
redshift, it is not a high-precision estimate, because the Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif">
line is intrinsically broad and affected by Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> absorption.
The <TT>spectro1d</TT> pipeline stores this as an additional
emission-line redshift.  This redshift information is stored in the
<TT>EmissionRedshift</TT> class (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecinfo">12</A>), which
includes an association to an object in the <TT>SpecObj</TT> class.  Thus
one <TT>SpecObj</TT> can have one or two <TT>EmissionRedshift</TT> objects 
associated with it.
<P>
If the highest <I>CL</I> emission line redshift uses lines only expected
for quasars (e.g., Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif">, C4, C3]; see Table
&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblreflines">30</A>), then the object is <EM>provisionally</EM>
classified as a quasar.  If any of the identified lines is broader
than 500&nbsp;km&nbsp;sec<IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2861" SRC="img20.gif"> (FWHM), then the object is also provisionally
classified as a quasar for the EDR.  
We expect that this threshold will change in
future data releases.  These provisional classifications
will hold up if the <EM>final</EM> redshift assigned to the object (see
below) agrees with its emission redshift.
<P>
Cross-Correlation Redshifts
<P>
The spectra are cross-correlated with stellar, emission-line
galaxy, and quasar template spectra to determine a cross-correlation
redshift and error.   
The cross-correlation templates are obtained from SDSS commissioning
spectra of high <I>S</I>/<I>N</I>, and comprise roughly one for each stellar
spectral type from B to almost L, a
non-magnetic and a magnetic white dwarf, an emission line galaxy, a composite
LRG spectrum, and a composite quasar
spectrum (from vandenberk01). The composites are based on
co-additions of <IMG WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3583" SRC="img187.gif"> spectra each. The template redshifts are
determined by cross-correlation with a large number of stellar spectra
from SDSS observations of the M67 star cluster, whose radial velocity
is precisely known.
<P>
When an object spectrum is cross-correlated with the stellar
templates, its found emission lines are masked out; i.e., the redshift
is derived from the absorption features. The cross-correlation routine
follows the technique of tonry79: the continuum-subtracted
spectrum is Fourier-transformed and convolved with the transform of
each template. For each template, the three highest Cross-Correlation
Function (CCF) peaks are found, fit with parabolas, and output with
their associated confidence limits (<I>CL</I>s). The corresponding redshift
errors are given by the widths of the CCF peaks. The cross-correlation
<I>CL</I>s are empirically calibrated as a function of peak level based on
manual inspection of a large number of spectra from the EDR.  
The final cross-correlation redshift is then chosen as the
one with the highest <I>CL</I> from among all the templates.
<P>
If there are discrepant high-<I>CL</I> cross-correlation peaks, i.e., if
the highest peak has <I>CL</I> &lt; 0.99 and the next highest peak corresponds
to a <I>CL</I> that is greater than <IMG WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3597" SRC="img188.gif"> of the highest peak, then the
code extends
the cross-correlation analysis for the corresponding templates to
lower wavenumber and includes the continuum in the analysis, i.e., it
chooses the redshift based on which template provides a better match
to the continuum shape of the object. These flagged spectra are then
manually inspected (see below).
<P>
The cross-correlation redshift is stored as <TT>z</TT> in the 
<TT>CrossCorrelationRedshift</TT> class.
<P>
Final Redshifts and Spectrum Classification
<P>
The <TT>spectro1d</TT> pipeline assigns a <EM>final</EM> redshift to each
object spectrum by choosing the emission or cross-correlation redshift
with the highest <I>CL</I>, and stores this as  <TT>z</TT> in the 
<TT>SpecObj</TT> class.  A redshift status
bitmask (<TT>zStatus</TT>) and a redshift warning bitmask (<TT>
zWarning</TT>) are stored, with bitmask values given in
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecobj">11</A>.  The <I>CL</I> is stored in <TT>zConf</TT>.  Objects
with redshifts determined manually (see below) have <I>CL</I> set to 0.95
(<TT>MANUAL_HIC</TT> set in <TT>zStatus</TT> ), or 0.4 or 0.65 (both <TT>
MANUAL_LOC</TT> set in <TT>zStatus</TT>).  Rarely, objects have the entire
red or blue half of the spectrum missing; such objects have their
<I>CL</I>s reduced by a factor of 2, so they are automatically flagged as
having low confidence, and the mask bits <TT>Z_WARNING_NO_BLUE</TT> or
<TT>Z_WARNING_NO_RED</TT> are set in <TT>zWarning</TT> as appropriate.
<P>
All objects are classified (in <TT>specClass</TT>) 
as either a quasar, high-<I>z</I> quasar, galaxy,
star, late-type star, or unknown.  If the object has been identified
as a quasar by the emission line routine, and if the emission line
redshift is chosen as the final redshift, then the object retains its
quasar classification.  Also, if the quasar cross-correlation template
provides the final redshift for the object, then the object is
classified as a quasar.  If the object has a final redshift <I>z</I>&gt;2.3 (so
that Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif"> is or should be present in the spectrum), 
and if at least 2 out of 3 redshift estimators agree on this 
(the 3 estimators being the emission-line, Ly<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3417" SRC="img151.gif">, and 
cross-correlation redshifts), then it is
classified as a high-<I>z</I> quasar.  If the object has a redshift <I>cz</I> &lt;
450&nbsp;km&nbsp;sec<IMG WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=9 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2861" SRC="img20.gif">, then it is classified as a star. If the final
redshift is obtained from one of the late-type stellar
cross-correlation templates, it is classified as a late-type star.  If
the object has a cross-correlation <I>CL</I>&lt; 0.25, it is classified as
unknown.
<P>
There exist among the spectra a small number of composite objects.
Most common are bright stars on top of galaxies, but there are also
galaxy-galaxy pairs at distinct redshifts, and at least one
galaxy-quasar pair, and one galaxy-star pair.  Most of these have the
<TT>zWarning</TT> flag set, indicating that more than one redshift was
found.
<P>
Additional Spectral Measures
<P>
For all objects, Gaussians are fit at the positions of all expected
emission lines in the reference list (see Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblreflines">30</A>),
not just the common lines, and their parameters are stored in the
class <TT>SpecLineIndex</TT> (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecinfo">12</A>).
<P>
For galaxies, we compute in the rest frame: the equivalent width, magnitude,
and their errors of a number of standard line indices, which are useful for
stellar population, age, and metallicity measures.  These are stored in <TT>
ew</TT>, <TT>ewErr</TT>, <TT>mag</TT>, and <TT>magErr</TT> in the class <TT>
SpecLineIndex</TT>.  The equivalent width and magnitude are not corrected for
velocity dispersion.  We only recommend the use of these line indices for
stellar population studies for galaxy spectra with good signal to noise ratio: <TT>sn[0]</TT>
of class <TT>SpecObj</TT> should be greater than 30.
<P>
A complete list of the lines we measure is available on our web sites.  They
were gathered from the following sources:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Lick line indices 
	(21 absorption-line strengths on the revised Lick/IDS line-strength
	system) trager98
<LI>CN, H+K, Ca1, G, H<IMG WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3625" SRC="img189.gif">, Mg, MH, FC, NaD brodie86
<LI>Ca2&nbsp;8498, Ca2&nbsp;8542, Ca2&nbsp;8662, 
Mg1&nbsp;8807 diaz89.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
We also calculate a measure of the strength of the 4000&#197; break as the ratio
of the flux from 3751-3951&#197; to the flux from 4051-4251&#197;, and the ratio
of the strength of the Ca K and H lines, as integrated from 3921-3946&#197; and
3956-3981&#197;, respectively.  These are also stored as ``lines'' in the class
<TT>SpecLineIndex</TT>, with the flux ratio stored in the parameter <TT>ew</TT>.
This flux ratio is used as a sanity check on the spectra.  If the break is in
the wrong direction (flux <EM>decreasing</EM> with increasing <IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline2921" SRC="img35.gif">), or if
the flux ratio is greater than 0.95, the <TT>Z_WARNING_4000BREAK</TT> bit is
set in <TT>zWarning</TT>.
<P>
Finally, galaxies are classified by a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) (connolly95a, as extended by
connollyszalay99), using cross-correlation with
eigentemplates constructed from early SDSS spectroscopic data. 
The 5 eigencoefficients
and a classification number are stored in <TT>eCoeff</TT> and <TT>
eClass</TT>, respectively, in the <TT>SpecObj</TT> class.  <TT>eClass</TT>
ranges from about -0.35 to 0.5 for early- to late-type galaxies.
<P>
In future data releases, we expect to implement more detailed stellar
spectral classification based on a larger set of stellar templates.
The velocity dispersion of each galaxy is currently a placeholder.  It
will be calculated and stored in a future release.
<P>
Redshift Warning flags
<P>
The <TT>zWarning</TT> bitmask mentioned above records problems that the
<TT>spectro1d</TT> pipeline found with each spectrum.  It provides
compact information about the spectra for end users, and it is also
used to trigger manual inspection of a subset of spectra on every
plate.  The bitmasks are listed in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="node65.html#tblspecobj">11</A>.  
Users should particularly heed warnings
about parts of the spectrum missing, low
signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum, significant discrepancies between
the various measures of the redshift, and especially low confidence 
in the redshift determination. In addition, redshifts for objects 
 with <TT>zStatus = FAILED</TT> should not be used.
<P>
Manual Inspection of Spectra
<P>
A small percentage of spectra on every plate are inspected manually
and, if necessary, the redshift, classification, <TT>zStatus</TT>, 
and <I>CL</I> are corrected.  We
inspect those spectra that have <TT>zWarning</TT> or <TT>zStatus</TT>
indicating that there were multiple high-confidence cross-correlation
redshifts, that the redshift was high (<I>z</I> &gt; 3.2 for quasar or <I>z</I> &gt;
0.5 for a galaxy), that the confidence was low, that signal-to-noise ratio
was low in <I>r</I>, or that the spectrum was not measured.  All objects 
with <TT>zStatus</TT> = <TT>EMLINE_HIC</TT> or <TT>EMLINE_LOC</TT>, i.e., 
for which the redshift was determined only by emission lines, are  
also examined. 
If, however, the object has a final
<I>CL</I>&gt;0.98 and <TT>zStatus</TT> of either <TT>XCORR_EMLINE</TT> or <TT>
EMLINE_XCORR</TT>, then, despite the above, it is not manually checked.
All objects with either <TT>specClass=SPEC_UNKNOWN</TT> or <TT>
zStatus=FAILED</TT> are manually inspected.
<P>
Roughly 8% of the spectra in the EDR were thus inspected, of which
about 1/8, or 1% overall, had the classification, redshift, <TT>
zStatus</TT>, or <I>CL</I> manually
corrected.  Such objects are flagged with <TT>zStatus</TT> changed to
<TT>MANUAL_HIC</TT> or <TT>MANUAL_LOC</TT>, depending on whether we had
high or low confidence in the manual inspection classification and
redshift.  Tests on the validation plates, described in the next
section, indicate that this selection of spectra for manual inspection
successfully finds <IMG WIDTH=49 HEIGHT=27 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3643" SRC="img190.gif"> of the spectra for which the automated
pipeline assigns an incorrect redshift.
