In regions of particularly poor seeing, the colors of stars were
occasionally systematically off, especially when earlier versions of
<TT>photo</TT> were used.  This caused the target selection algorithms
that select outliers in color-color space to choose an inordinate
number of targets.  We corrected for this
by manually culling targets from the list.
<P>
In particular, target candidates were culled from run 752 (Target
v2.2a) in 61 fields due to 
problems caused by poor seeing.  In fields with 5 or more quasar
candidates, we removed candidates which were not also selected as
galaxy targets, in the following categories:
<UL>
<LI>
<TT>TARGET_QSO_HIZ</TT>, <TT>TARGET_QSO_CAP</TT>, <TT>TARGET_QSO_SKIRT</TT>,
<LI>
<TT>TARGET_QSO_FIRST_CAP</TT>, <TT>TARGET_QSO_FIRST_SKIRT</TT>,
<LI>
<TT>TARGET_SERENDIP_BLUE</TT>, <TT>TARGET_SERENDIP_RED</TT>,
<LI> <TT>TARGET_SERENDIP_DISTANT</TT>, <TT>TARGET_STAR_SUB_DWARF</TT>,
<LI>
<TT>TARGET_STAR_WHITE_DWARF</TT>, <TT>TARGET_STAR_CARBON</TT>.  
</UL>
<P>
Similarly, target candidates in runs 94, 125 (Target v2.7) were culled
from 52 fields.  Additionally, all <TT>QSO_HIZ</TT> candidates in run 94
in camera column 6 were removed from the list.  This was necessary due
to a problem with the characterization of the point spread function in
the version of the <TT>psp</TT> used at the time.
<P>
After the plates from run 94/125 were drilled, we discovered that many
quasar candidates were targeted, due to an error in the target
selection code.  Spectra were collected for these targets, but they
may be removed from quasar analyses by rejecting objects which satisfy
the criterion: <IMG WIDTH=335 HEIGHT=26 ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline3495" SRC="img175.gif">.
