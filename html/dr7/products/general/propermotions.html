<h1>Data products: General - Proper Motions</H1>

<p> In DR1, proper motions were calculated by matching SDSS positions
against USNO-A2.0 (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998yCat.1252....0M">Monet
et al. 1998</a>).  USNO-A2.0 provides positions at a single epoch; no
proper motions are provided.  Thus, for each SDSS object, the closest
matching object in USNO-A2.0 was assumed to be a valid match and the
proper motion calculated from the pair of detections, with a typical
time baseline of 50 years.  For motions greater than roughly 40
mas/year, corresponding to separations between the SDSS and USNO-A2.0
positions of greater than 2 arcsec, contamination by false matches
becomes significant and rises with increasing motion/separation.</p>

<p>For DR2/DR3, the SDSS positions were matched against USNO-B1.0 (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AJ....125..984M">Monet
et al. 2003</a>), which provides positions and proper motions.  Each
SDSS object is matched to the nearest USNO-B1.0 object within 1
arcsec, after first converting the USNO-B1.0 positions to the epoch of
the SDSS observations.  This eliminates nearly all of the false
matches, yielding much cleaner samples of high proper motion stars.
The USNO-B1.0 proper motion is then given for each matching SDSS
object.</p>
