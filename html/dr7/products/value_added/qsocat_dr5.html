<h1>Fourth edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog</h1>

<p>The DR5 quasar catalog is described in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....134..102S">Schneider et
al. 2007, AJ 134, 102</a>. The catalog contains 77,429 objects from
DR5 that have apparent <var>i</var>-band PSF magnitude fainter than
15, absolute <var>i</var>-band magnitudes brighter than -22, contain
at least one emission line or are unambiguously broad absorption line
quasars, and have highly reliable redshifts. The catalog was created
by inspecting all spectra that were either targeted as quasar
candidates, or classified as a quasar by the <a
href="../../algorithms/redshift_type.html">spectroscopic
pipelines</a>.</p>

<h3>SDSS Quasar Catalog redshifts supersede those in other data
products</h3>

<p>Because of the re-inspection of the spectra, the DR5 Quasar Catalog
provides the most reliable classifications and redshifts of SDSS
quasars. The classifications in the catalog supersede those found in
other data products accessible from the <a href="../../access/">data
access page</a>, as well as from the DR3, DR1 and EDR quasar
catalogs. The improved classifications will be fed back into other
data products for future data releases.</p>

<h3>The DR5 Quasar Catalog is not a statistical sample</h3>

<p>There are two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It includes objects from all categories of <a
      href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection</a> in SDSS, not just those
      selected as quasar candidates.</li>
  <li><p>While the catalog contains both the
      <code>TARGET</code> selection flags used to select spectroscopic
      targets, and the <code>BEST</code> selection flags obtained by
      applying the final target selection version (sometimes to better
      photometric data obtained later during the survey), use of the <code>BEST</code> data
      produces a different set of quasar candidates than the
      <code>TARGET</code> version that was used to define
      spectroscopic plates, even for those parts of the sky that were
      targeted using the <a
      href="../../algorithms/target.html#qso">final quasar target
      selection algorithm</a> described in <a
      href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n6/201557/201557.html">Richards
      et al. 2002</a>.  If one uses the <code>BEST</code> photometry
      to define a statistical sample, not only must one drop catalog
      entries which were not selected by the final version, but one also has to
      account for missing quasar candidates, i.e., those identified by
      the final target selection algorithm but without spectroscopic
      observations. A forthcoming paper will discuss the construction
      of a statistical quasar sample in detail.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These caveats aside, the selection of UV excess quasars has
remained reasonably uniform. These constitute 89% of the
color-selected objects, and 63% of the total DR5 Catalog. Changes to
the target selection algorithm were primarily aimed at improving the
effectiveness of the identification of <var>z</var>&gt; 2.5
quasars.</p>
