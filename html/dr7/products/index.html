<h1>SDSS Data Products</h1>

<h2>DR7 and other data releases</h2>

<p><a href="../start/aboutDR7.html">About DR7</a> explains the
contents of this data release and its relation to other data releases
(also see the <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/science/DRschedule.html">SDSS data release
schedule)</a> DR7's sky coverage is shown on the 
<a href="../coverage/">Sky Coverage</a> page.</p>

<h2>Data access</h2>

<p>Fits images, spectra and catalog tables are served by the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/">Data Archive Server (DAS)</a>. You can
also search and brows all catalogs and jpeg images through the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr7/">Catalog Archive Server (CAS)</a>
database.  For an overview of the various search forms, see the <a
href="../access/index.html">data access</a> page.</p>

<h2>Data products overview</h2>

<h3><a href="./images/index.html">Images - using SDSS as your
telescope</a></h3>

<p>SDSS provides FITS image files of the corrected frames in five
bands, a mask that records how each pixel was used in the imaging
pipelines, 4 x 4 binned images of the corrected frames after detected
objects have been removed, and "atlas" images, which include all
significant pixels around each object. This page describes imaging
frames, how to get them and related files from the survey archive, and
how to work with them.</p>

<h3><a href="./catalogs/index.html">Object lists - using SDSS as your
photometric catalog</a></h3>

<p>The calibrated object lists are FITS tables containing positions,
fluxes, and shapes of all objects detected at &gt;5 sigma on the
images. This page describes the lists, how to get them and related
files from the archive, and how to work with them.</p>

<h3><a href="./spectra/index.html">Spectra and spectroscopic
parameters - using SDSS as your spectrograph</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li>"2d" spectra: FITS files of the flux- and
      wavelength-calibrated, sky-subtracted spectra, with error and mask
      arrays and resolution at each pixel. 640 spectra per file.</li>
  <li>"1d" spectra: FITS files with the calibrated spectra and error and
      mask arrays, redshift, spectral classification, and detected lines of
      each spectrum.</li>
</ul>

<p>The page describes calibrated spectra, how to get them and related
files from the archive, and how to work with them.</p>

<h3><a href="./tiling/index.html">Tiling - using SDSS as your complete
survey</a></h3>

<p>"Tiling" means optimising the placement of spectroscopic tiles on
the sky and assignment of spectroscopic fibers to targets in the
spectroscopic survey. This section describes the tiling files, how to
get them and related files from the archive, and how to characterise
the survey's non-uniformity using them.</p>

<h3>Other data products</h3>

<p>These include astrometric calibrations, photometric calibrations,
gif and postscript plots of spectra, and <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/chart/chart.asp">finding
charts</a> in postscript/jpeg/fits formats.</p>

<h3><a href="./value_added/index.html">Value Added Data
Products</a></h3> The SDSS collaboration has created catalogs and
other data products based on public survey data that are of general use.


<h2>IAU designations for SDSS objects</h2>

<p><a href="../coverage/IAU.html">Use IAU designations</a> in publications.</p>

<h2>Data model</h2>

<p>The <a href="../dm/flatFiles/FILES.html">flat-file data model</a>
contains detailed descriptions of all data generated by the data
processing. The <a
  href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/docs/intro.asp">Archive
  Intro</a> page and the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/browser/browser.asp">SQL
Schema Browser</a> describe how data are stored in the <a
href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server (CAS)</a>.

<h2>Data quality overviews</h2>

<h3>Imaging</h3>

<p>There are various quality assurance algorithms for photometry, some
of which consider each run in isolation, and some of which consider
overlapping parts of different runs. Since DR4, we make available the
summary and single-run QA data and plots, which analyze the PSF, the
difference between aperture and PSF magnitudes of stars, and the
location of the stellar locus in color-color space. Details are
available on the <a href="./qa/index.html"> QA pages</a>.</p>

The following overviews cover the quality of other aspects
of imaging.
