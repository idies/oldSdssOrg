<h2>DR7 contains completely reprocessed spectra.</h2>

<p>In DR7, there have been improvements to the algorithms
which photometrically calibrate the spectra, and all spectra have been
re-reduced. The new spectro "rerun number" is 26.</p>

<h2>About spectroscopic samples</h2>

<h3>Normal survey plates</h3>

<p>The spectroscopic survey is predominantly a survey for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bright galaxies, the "main" sample, with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band
    magnitude &lt; 17.77 (to get an idea of their distribution, see
      this <a href="./pieplot.ps">pie plot showing the redshift
      distribution of 78275 DR1 galaxies with
      -15&deg; &lt; DEC &lt; 20&deg;</a>).</li>
  <li>Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band magnitude
    down to 19.5 (see this <a href="./zdist.ps">redshift distribution
      of DR2 "main" galaxies and LRGs</a>), and</li>
  <li>Quasars, targetting  quasar candidates as faint as <var>i &lt;
      20.2</var> (see this <a href="./qsozdist.ps">DR2 quasar
      redshift distribution</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a large number of spectra of stars. Brown dwarfs, ROSAT and
FIRST counterparts are targetted as well. Refer to the <a
href="../general/target_quality.html">target selection quality</a> or <a
href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithm</a> for
details about the spectroscopic survey targets.</p>

<h3>Extra and special plates, including SEGUE</h3>

<p>New since DR4 is the publication of &quot;extra&quot; and
&quot;special&quot; plates. <strong>Extra plates</strong> are repeat
observations of normal survey plates. These have the same plate number
as the original observation, but a different MJD and usually <em>a
different mapping between fiber number and
ra,dec</em>. <strong>Special plates</strong> are spectroscopic
observations made under a variety of special programs which are
described on the <a href="./special.html">special spectra
page</a>.</p>

<p>Note the caveat below about <a href="#specialquery">querying
 special-plate data in the CAS (including SEGUE)</a>.</p>


<h2>Getting and using spectra</h2>

<p>The spectra distributed by the SDSS have been sky subtracted,
corrected for telluric absorption <a
href="../../algorithms/spectrophotometry.html">spectrophotometrically
calibrated</a> by the Spectro2d pipeline.  Spectral classification,
redshift determination, and emission and absorption line measurements
are carried out by the &quot;1D&quot; pipeline. DR7 
contains the outputs from two independent 1D pipelines: the
<code>spectro1d</code> code that has also been used in all previous
releases, and the <a
href="../algorithms/redshift_type.html#specBS"><code>specBS</code></a>
code whose outputs (&quot;Princeton reductions&quot;) were previously
available only from <a
href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">spectro.princeton.edu</a>. The CAS
contains only the <code>spectro1d</code> outputs as before; the
<code>specBS</code> outpus are available through the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">DAS</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../algorithms/index.html">algorithms page</a>
contains details about spectroscopic data processing for all pipelines.</p>

<p>Since DR1, the Data Archive Server has been providing the same spectrum in two
files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spectro2d <code>spPlate*.fits</code>:
      all calibrated spectra and supporting data (signal-to-noise,
      resolution, quality flags and similar) from a single plate,
      without any parameters or continuum fits. <strong>In
      DR7:</strong> the spPlate files now also contain the sky spectra
      that have been used for sky subtraction of each spectrum.<br />
      See the <a
    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spPlate.html"><code>spPlate*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents. There is one <code>2d</code>
      directory for every plate number in the DAS that contains all
      <code>spPlate</code> files for that plate, including those for
      different MJDs where repeats are available; e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/spectro/2d_26/0644/">http://das.sdss.org/spectro/2d_26/0644/</a></li>
  <li>Spectro1d <code>spSpec*.fits</code>:
      multiple fits extensions (images and tables) with the calibrated
      spectrum, a continuum-subtracted spectrum, and all measured parameters
      (redshift, line fits, line indices, per-pixel resolution). See
      the <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html"><code>spSpec*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents, and <a
      href="./read_spSpec.html">how to read an spSpec file</a>. There
      is one spSpec file per plate/MJD/fiber combination, found in a
      parallel <code>1d</code>directory tree with one directory
      per plate, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/0644/1d/">http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/0644/1d/</a></li>
  <li>In addition, spectro1d produces <code>spPlot*.gif,.ps</code>
      plots of the spectra with line locations for the best-fitting
      redshift, again in one directory per plate, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/0644/gif/">http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/0644/gif/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above files are available through the <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/">DAS query form</a>.</p>

<p>DR7 provides additional spectroscopic data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectro2d <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spCFrame.html"><code>spCFrame*.fits</code></a>:
      SDSS spectra are typically combined from 3 or more individual
      exposures of 15 minutes each. The individual flux-calibrated
      spectrograph exposures are available in spCFrame*.fits
      files. <strong>They contain spectra in the spectrograph's native
      wavelength mapping, which is neither linear in wavelength nor
      log-wavelength.</strong><br />
  </li>

  <li><a
  href="../../algorithms/redshift_type.html#specBS"><code>specBS</code></a>
  outputs (&quot;Princeton reductions&quot;; see <a
  href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">http://spectro.princeton.edu</a>):
      
      <ul>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZbest.html"><code>spZbest*.fits</code></a>:
	    best-fit classification and redshift for a given
	    spectrum</li>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZall.html"><code>spZall*.fits</code></a>:
	    Same structure aas spZbest, but contains all attempted
	    fits</li>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZline.html"><code>spZline*.fits</code></a>:
	    emission-line measurements</li>
      </ul>
      There is one file of each type for every plate/MJD
      combination.</li>
  <li><code>sspp</code> stellar parameter pipeline outputs: Most of
      these outputs are available only through two new  tables in the CAS:
      <ul>
	<li>Line index equivalent widths for stars:
	    <a href="./spectrolineindices.html">sppLines</a></li>
	<li>Stellar atmospheric parameters ([Fe/H], log g, Teff) for stars:
	    <a href="./spectroparameters.html">sppParams</a>
	    for all the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/segue/index.html">SEGUE</a>
	    spectra and a large fraction of the main
	    database spectra classified as stars (not galaxies or quasars).
	</li>
      </ul>
      In the DAS, we provide bulk versions of the stellar parameter
      outputs in one directory per plate/MJD combination, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/spectro/sspp_26/0644-52149">spectro/sspp_26/0644-52149</a>,
      which include .csv  versions of the sppParams and sppLines
      tables and some additional information and plots not available through the
      CAS.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The specBS outputs are available through the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/">DAS query form</a>. The
<code>spCFrame</code> files are not available through the DAS query
form, but can be found in the same <code>2d</code> directories as the
<code>spPlate</code> files in the DAS; these also contain the specBS
outputs. E.g., <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/spectro/2d_26/0644/">http://das.sdss.org/spectro/2d_26/0644/</a>.</p>

<h3>Bulk download of spectra, spectroscopic parameters, and corresponding imaging data</h3>

<p> Very often one wishes to obtain all the SDSS photometric (imaging
camera) data associated with each spectrum.  One can obtain this
information most easily for nearly all plates through the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">SQS</a>
interface by selecting imaging parameters to return with your selected
spectra.</p>

<p>For those who prefer working with the full fits files of spectra
and imaging catalogs, make available a special set of files
(<code>spObj-*.fit</code>) containing a bundled version of the
spectroscopic data and all the corresponding imaging data.</p>

<p>These files are available via
the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/">DAS</a> by requesting the data
product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish. To get these files in bulk for the entire survey, see
the <a href="./getspectra.html">page on redshift catalogs and SDSS
spectra and corresponding imaging data</a>.</p>

<h3>More on data access</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to get spectra by coordinates, or to search for spectra by
redshift, object magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve them from the
archive. In particular, the <a
href="../../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> provides
a fast search capability for object lists and spectroscopic parameters
as well as pointers to the files in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">Data Archive Server</a>, whose
structure is explained on the <a href="../../data/index.html">Data
Archive Server structure and contents page</a>. The <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro Query
Server</a> query form is dedicated to the search of the spectroscopic
database. You can also download fits tables with the classification,
redshifts and other information from the <a
href="./getspectra.html">page with redshift catalogs and
spectro+imaging data</a>.</p>

<p>Please note the <a href="#caveats">caveats</a> below, which are
essential to obtain meaningful scientific results from analysing SDSS
spectra, in particular the <a href="#zstatus">redshift status
caveat</a>.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h3>DAS only plates</h3>

	A few Legacy and SEGUE plates either did not have
	sufficient exposure time to reach their target S/N in
	order to be declared 'done'.  Also, in the case of SEGUE,
	3 plates have bright but not faint equivalents (or vice-versa).
	These plates do not appear in the CAS or in the list of
	all plates, however, they are available in the DAS.
	The plate-mjd numbers for these plates are:

<pre>
 plate-mjd      Why not in CAS platex table:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0356-51779    S/N too low -- plate not done (not enough exposure)
 1112-53180    S/N too low -- plate not done
 1858-53271    SEGUE test plate, high DEC, never made it to CAS
 2309-54441    S/N too low -- SEGUE plate
 2333-53676    M71 very bright plate, lots of saturation, only 320/640 done
 2535-54632    SEGUE bright, faint matching plate not done 
 2640-54474    BAOTest plate, test plate for SDSS-III 
 2716-54629    SEGUE bright, faint matching plate not done
 2813-54650    SEGUE bright, insufficient S/N, plate not done
 2851-54485    SEGUE dup pointing of plate 2045.
 2962-54578    don't have correct tsObj file, Low S/N, plate not done
</pre>

<a name="rvredshift"></a>
<h3> Note on Radial Velocities</h3>
The DAS records ELODIE-matched template redshifts for all stars
        as the quantity elodie_z in the spZbest* file for
        each plate.  The CAS records this as the quantity elodierv in
        the sppParams table in the BESTDR7 Context.  The elodierv =
        c*elodie_z+7.3 km/s, where the 7.3 is an empirically
        derived offset putting the elodierv of all stars on
        a system consistent with that of other literature measures
        of known radial velocity standards.

Two other redshifts, the specBS redshift and the Spectro redshift
        are available, unaltered, in the sppParams table (or spbsparams view).
        These redshifts, primarily for galaxy work, do not have
        the 7.3 km/s offset applied.

<p>
<a name="zstatus"></a>
<h3>Redshift status</h3>

<p> Only 1% of the objects have an "unknown" classification, usually
because of low signal-to-noise ratio or completely featureless
spectra. The redshifts of all but a few tenths of a percent of the
remainder are believed to be correct. <strong>To identify the few
objects with unreliable redshifts, be sure to consider the confidence
we have assigned to each redshift (<code>z_conf</code> in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html">spSpec*.fits primary header</a>,
and the status <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zstatus"><code>zStatus</code></a>
and <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zwarning"><code>zWarnin</code></a>
of the redshift measurement, which may have failed.</strong>). A
useful cut on the redshift confidence is <code>z_conf &gt; 0.35</code>
(or <code>zConf &gt; 0.35</code> in the SQL database).
<!-- See <a href="XXXmissinglinkXXX">spectroscopy documentation on -->

<h3>Galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./galextinction.html"-->

<h3>Night sky emission lines</h3>

<p>The night sky emission lines at 5577&Aring, (when there is auroral
activity) at 6300&Aring;, 6363&Aring;, and in the OH forest in the red
can be very strong, and leave significant residuals in the spectra
whose amplitude is occasionally underestimated by the noise model.  Be
cautious about interpreting the reality of weak features close to
these lines.</p>

<a name="badplates"></a>
<h3>Plates with not-quite-perfect spectrophotometry</h3>

<p>A small number of plates, given in the <a href="badplates.txt">list
of not-quite-perfect plates</a>, suffered from a variety of minor
problems.  The CCD frames for several plates suffered from a transient
electronic problem in the red camera in Spectrograph 2, causing the
columns of the CCD to be misaligned on readout.  This was fixed in
software, and we believe the data to be reliable.  Another set of
plates labeled &quot;Spectrograph Collimation Problem&quot; suffered
from having the spectrograph collimator improperly focused.  This
problem caused a mismatch between the flatfields and the science
exposure instrumental profile shapes on the CCD in both the spatial
and wavelength directions, causing the optimal extraction process to
reject an excessive number of pixels.  This problem was fixed in
software, and comparing overlapping objects from adjacent plates
confirms that the redshifts from these problematic plates are
unbiased.  However, the spectra themselves should not be used for
precision work or spectrophotometry.  Other plates have individual
problems as noted. E.g., during the exposure of one plate, light from
an LED somewhere on the telescope found its way to the spectrographs,
resulting in an artificial excess of light centered roughly at
6500&Aring;; the spectrophotometry of this plate is quite poor.</p>

<a name="specphotomismatch"></a>
<h3>Mismatches between spectra and photometric data</h3>

<p>In a few cases, the fiber mapping failed which identifies which
fiber has been plugged into which hole. When this happens for two or
more objects on the sample plate, there is the possibility of wrong
matches between spectra and photometric objects. There are 123 objects
for which the mapping between object and spectrum cannot be
established (&quot;unmapped fibers&quot;); their ra/dec is listed as
-9999 in the spectroscopic data set but synthetic fiber magnitudes
(<code>mag_0, mag_1, mag_2</code> in the <code>specObj</code> tables
in the CAS, <code>mag_g, mag_r, mag_i</code> in the
<code>spSpec*.fit</code> files) greater than 0 (i.e., use the
synthetic magnitudes to distinguish the unmapped fibers from the 2221
fibers which were broken completely at the time of observations and
did not yield a spectrum at all).</p>

<p>Errors in the deblending algorithm in the <code>target</code> reductions
caused spectroscopy to be carried out occasionally on non-existent
objects (e.g., diffraction spikes of bright stars or satellite
trails).  Many of these objects no longer exist in the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions with its improvements to the deblender.  In other
cases, the photometric pipeline timed out during the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions in fields for which <code>target</code> imaging proceeded
without problem, so that the <code>best</code> photometry is missing for
bona-fide objects. This predominantly happens in fields close to a few
very bright stars.  We expect to recover objects from these ``timeout
holes'' in future data releases.</p>

<a name="specialquery"></a>
<p>The <a href="./special.html">special plates</a> have special issues
regarding photometric matches. Some of the special plates were
targeted using photometry that is not part of DR7, or not even SDSS
photometry.  Therefore, the SDSS photometry for objects on plates 797,
1468, 1471, 1472, 1665, and 1666 is only available through <a
href="../../start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, special plates with SDSS photometry are different from
regular SDSS plates in that they have no tiling information associated
with them. Therefore, the <code>specPhotoAll</code> table is not
populated with all entries from special plates.  
Querying SEGUE data is explained in a <a
href="../../../segue/getstarted.html#ex4">SEGUE sample SQL
query</a>.</p>

<p>To obtain photometric information for non-SEGUE special-plate
spectra, perform the following join:</p>
<pre>
select columns
from specObjAll as so
inner join photoObj as po on so.bestobjid = po.objid</pre>

<p>

<!-- <p>A total of 663 spectroscopic objects therefore do not have a -->
<!-- counterpart in the <code>best</code> catalogs, 0.2% of the total.  Of -->
<!-- these, 80 (including the 62 unmapped fibers) can only be retrieved -->
<!-- from the table <code>specObjAll</code> in the database.  The remaining -->
<!-- 583 objects are contained in the default spectroscopic table -->
<!-- <code>specObj</code>, but will not be found by queries requesting both -->
<!-- photometric and spectroscopic information.</p> -->

<a name="galveldisp"></a>
<h3>Galaxy velocity dispersion measurements</h3>

<p>The velocity dispersion measurements distributed with SDSS spectra
use template spectra convolved to a maximum sigma of 420
km/s. Therefore, velocity dispersion sigma &gt; 420 km/s are not
reliable and must not be used. The figure below shows the quality of
velocity dispersion error estimates.<p>

<div class="cfig"> <img width="475px" src="../../algorithms/vdisp_errcomp.png"> <p
class="cfig"> Error distribution of the velocity dispersion
measurements from spectro1d DR6 (thin black solid line), spectro1d DR5
(dotted red line), specBS (dashed blue line), and B03 (dotted-dashed
green line). The thick solid line was obtained by comparing repeated
measurements.</p> </div>

<p></p>

<p>We recommend the user to not use SDSS velocity dispersion measurements
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectra with median per-pixel S/N &lt; 10</li>
  <li>velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70 km s<sup>-1</sup>
    given the typical S/N and the instrumental resolution of the SDSS
  spectra</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that the velocity dispersion measurements are not corrected to a
standard relative circular aperture.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../algorithms/veldisp.html">velocity dispersion
algorithm</a> for details.</p>

<a name="bonusplates"></a>
<h3>"Bonus" plates beyond the survey limits</h3>

<p>A few plates target objects beyond the <a
href="../../coverage/atStripeDef.par">survey limits</a> for a
particular survey stripe, stripe 10 (see <a
href="../../coverage/index.html">survey coverage page</a>).  These
plate/MJD combinations are:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Plate</th><th>MJD</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>343</td><td>51692 (straddles stripe limits)</td>

    <td>364</td><td>52000</td>
</table>

<p>Their corresponding <code>target</code>imaging data does not
contain any <code>PRIMARY</code> objects. Objects from this region are
therefore not available via a normal search of the <code>target</code>
object lists.  To find the target data, select on <code>status &
0x402</code> (both <code>GOOD</code> and <code>OK_SCANLINE</code>)
instead of selecting on the <code>PRIMARY</code> flag being set in
<code>status</code>. The information is also contained in the
<code>spObj-*.fit</code> files, which are available for all plates.
These files are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish.  They are also available for bulk <a
href="../../data/rsync.html">rsync</a> or <a
href="http://wget.sunsite.dk">wget</a> download via <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/">DAS through http </a> (in
<code>spectro/ss_SPRERUN/PLATE/spObj-*</code>).</p>

<p>These objects have been declared <code>primary</code> in the
<code>best</code> data set.  The CAS correctly records the positional
matches between these spectra and their counterparts in
<code>best</code>. However, since the corresponding targets are not
primary, the spectra are not included in the <code>specObj</code> and
<code>specPhoto</code> views in the CAS, but must be searched
explicitly in <code>specObjAll</code> and
<code>photoObjAll</code>.</p>

<h3>Accuracy of stellar radial velocities</h3>

<p>The <a href="./radvelocity.html">accuracy of stellar radial
velocities in DR2/DR3 and beyond</a> is described on a separate page.</p>

<a name="clipped"></a>
<h3>Clipped Spectral Lines</h3>

<p>The spectroscopic pipeline combines observations of a given object on the red 
and blue spectrographs, and between the separate 15-minute exposures on the sky, 
by fitting a tightly-constrained spline to the data, allowing discrepant points 
such as cosmic rays to be rejected. This spline requires as input the effective 
resolution of the spectra.</p>

<p>As described in the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007arXiv0707.3413A">DR6 paper</a>, 
it did not do a perfect job; occasionally, very strong and sharp emission lines were erroneously 
rejected by this algorithm. This turned out to be due to the fact that the spline code did not 
adequately track the changing resolution of the spectra as a function of wavelength and fiber 
number. Including this effect much improved the behavior of this algorithm.  The figure below shows 
an example spectrum of an object affected by this problem in DR6, and its improved counterpart 
in DR7, as is apparent by the correct 3:1 ratio of the 5007 and 4959 &Aring; lines of [OIII]. 
The total number of objects that were affected by this problem is quite small; affecting less 
than 1 percent of galaxies with H&beta; equivalent width >25 &Aring;.

<p>There is another problem, unfortunately not fixed in DR7, which has a similar effect. If the 
line is so bright that it is saturated in the individual 15-minute exposures of the spectrograph, 
it will also appear clipped.  Unfortunately, such saturated pixels are not flagged as such, 
although usually such lines are recognizeable as having an inverse variance equal to zero.</p>

<p>Luckily, objects with such strong emission lines are very rare, but the user should be aware 
of the possibility of objects with extremely strong emission lines and unphysical or unusual line 
ratios.</p>
