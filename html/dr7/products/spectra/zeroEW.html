<p>There is a bug in the line-measurement code that has been in use
since DR3 which gives some emission lines an equivalent width of zero,
even though there is a significant line detection. The aim of the
change introducing the bug had been to determine the equivalent width
by integrating the spectrum, instead of using the parameters of a
fitted Gaussian. The Gauss-fit equivalent width can be recovered from the
fit parameters using the usual expression <code>EW = 2.5066 * sigma *
height / continuum</code>.</p>
