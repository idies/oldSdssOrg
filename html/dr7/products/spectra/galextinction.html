<p>In the EDR and DR1, the spectroscopic data were nominally corrected
for galactic extinction.  The spectrophotometry since DR2 is vastly
improved compared to DR1, but the final calibrated spectra in DR2 and
beyond are <em>not</em> corrected for foreground Galactic reddening (a
relatively small effect; the median <var>E(B-V)</var> over the survey
is 0.034).  Users of spectra should note that the fractional
improvement in spectrophotometry from DR1 to DR2 and beyond was much
greater than the extinction correction itself. As the SDSS includes a
substantial number of spectra of galactic stars, a decision has been
taken <strong>not</strong> to apply any extinction correction to
spectra, since it would only be appropriate for extragalactic objects,
but to report the observational result of the SDSS, namely, the
spectrum including galactic extinction.</p>
