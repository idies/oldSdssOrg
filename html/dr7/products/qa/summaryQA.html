<h2>Summary QA quantities</h2>

<p>The SDSS imaging data are taken as a series of <i>runs</i>
(typically indicated by a four-digit number).  Each run is made up of
six parallel <i>scanlines</i>, and each scanline is divided up further
into 10'x13' <i>frames</i>.  Global photometric quality assurance is
done both on individual frames, and on each run.  These global
quantities are based on the detailed quality assurance tests carried
out in <a href="./singlerunQA.html">single-run QA</a>.</p>

<h3>Summary Run quality assurance</h3>

<p>This is summarized in the third table in <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/QA/summaryQA_analyzePC.html">a
summary of the SDSS run quality assurance results</a> (the DRsupplemental
list is available <a href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/QA/summaryQA_analyzePC.html">here</a>).  This includes
links to the single-run QA for each of the imaging runs.  The
following is a description of the method used to assign an overall
quality to the run.</p>

<p>Each field has four <a
href="./singlerunQA.html#principal">principal colors</a> determined
from the locus of stars in color-color space; these principal colors
are normalized to average to zero over the survey.  The median value
of the principal colors in each camera column gives a measure of the
quality of the photometric calibration of that camera column. The
following table shows how the run quality is determined.<p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Quality</th>
    <th>All four abs(median color) are at most...</th>
    <th>...in at least this many camera columns</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SUPERB</td>
    <td>0.01</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EXCELLENT</td>
    <td>0.02</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GOOD</td>
    <td>0.03</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ACCEPTABLE</td>
    <td>0.03</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To give an impression of how common each value is, he following
table shows the distribution of field quality values in DR4.</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>QUALITY</th>
    <th># of fields</th>
    <th>%</th>
    <th># of fields this good or better</th>
    <th>%</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EXCELLENT</td>
    <td>147001</td>
    <td>58</td>
    <td>147001</td>
    <td>58</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GOOD</td>
    <td>67196</td>
    <td>26</td>
    <td>214197</td>
    <td>84</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ACCEPTABLE</td>
    <td>32980</td>
    <td>13</td>
    <td>247177</td>
    <td>97</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BAD</td>
    <td>7990</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>255167</td>
    <td>100</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>To within the accuracy given here, the fractional distribution of
field quality was identical in DR3 and DR4 (with about 201,000 and
255,000 fields, respectively).</p>

<p>There are separate criteria on the quality of each field based on
the seeing and the quality of the PSF determination, as explained in
detail <a href="./singlerunQA.html#quality">in the quality section of
the single-run QA page</a>; the summary  
<a href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/QA/summaryQA_analyzePC.html">table</a> also indicates the fraction of fields in each run of different 
quality by these criteria.</p>

<h3>Summary Field quality assurance</h3>

<p>At a finer level, the quality of each of the hundreds of thousands
of fields in the SDSS imaging data is assessed, and is summarized in a
<a
href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/QA/summaryQA_FieldPhotomQuality.dat">very
large ascii file</a>.  The following description of the assignment of
quality flag is taken straight from the <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AJ....129.1755A">SDSS
DR3 paper</a>.</p>

<p>This flag is based on five attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The seeing in the <i>r</i> band</li>
  <li>As a diagnostic of errors in the determination of the Point
      Spread Function (PSF) magnitude, the difference between aperture and
      PSF magnitude for bright stars on the 
      frame, as described <a href="./singlerunQA.html#PSF">in the PSF
      section of the single-run QA page</a></li>
  <li>Systematic offsets of the stellar locus in color space, and/or
      increased width of the stellar locus, using the <a
      href="./singlerunQA.html#principal">principal colors</a></li>
  <li>Finally, the initial processing of the data itself can indicate
      problems: the photometric pipeline can time-out in processing, the
      telescope tracking can be poor, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these quantities, we assign a field quality for each field
as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> By default, the field in question is assigned quality 
    ACCEPTABLE.</li>
  <li> If the absolute value of the median PSF-aperture difference is
    greater than 0.05 magnitudes in any of the five bands, or if the
    absolute value of the <i>s</i> color median is larger than 0.05
    magnitudes, or if the <i>s</i> color distribution width is 2.5 times
    larger than its median value for the whole run, or if the <i>r</i>-band
    seeing is worse than 3 arcseconds, or if the initial processing
    indicates severe problems with the data, the field in question is
    downgraded  to BAD. </li>
  <li> If the absolute median PSF-aperture difference is smaller than 0.03
        magnitudes in all five bands, and if the absolute value
        of the <i>s</i> color median is smaller than 0.03 mag, and if the
        <i>s</i> color distribution width is smaller than twice
        its median value for the whole run, the field in question is
        upgraded to GOOD.</li>
  <li> If the median PSF-aperture difference is smaller than 0.02
        magnitudes in all five bands, and if the absolute value
        of the <i>s</i> color median is smaller than 0.02 mag, and if the
        <i>s</i> color distribution width is smaller than 1.5 times
        its median value for the whole run, and the $r$-band seeing
        is better than 2 arcseconds, the field in question is
        upgraded to EXCELLENT.</li>
</ul>
