<h2>Overview of Quality Assurance</h2>

<p>In order to assess the overall quality of the SDSS imaging data, each
SDSS imaging run goes through a  series of tests to confirm its
overall photometric and astrometric quality.  This document describes
these tests in detail, in particular the detailed web pages that are
made summarizing the results.  These quality assurance tests have
developed over the course of the survey, and have several goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To flag possible problems in the telescope or imaging camera;</li>
  <li> To flag possible problems in the data themselves (caused by
      clouds, poor seeing, etc.)</li>
  <li> To flag possible problems in the image processing or photometric
      or astrometric calibration;</li>
  <li> To give quantitative measures of the accuracy of the SDSS
      photometry and astrometry, and their errors. </li>
</ul>
      
<p>These pages describing the QA output are not meant to be read
end-to-end, but rather to be used as a reference for those using the
QA outputs to understand the quality of a given set of SDSS data.  We
have a <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/QA/summaryQA_FieldPhotomQuality.dat">summary
of the photometric quality of each SDSS image frame</a>. The file
contents are described in detail in the <a
href="./summaryQA.html">summaryQA documentation</a>.  A description of
the QA mechanisms may also be found in <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004AN....325..583I">Ivezic
et al. 2004</a>.</p>

<h2>Types of imaging QA</h2>

<p>There are two types of quality assurance carried out for each SDSS
imaging run: that produced by each pipeline (astrom, psp, frames, and
nfcalib; see the EDR paper for descriptions of each of these
pipelines, as well as the paper by Pier et al. (2003) for the
astrometry) to diagnose immediate problems with running the pipeline,
and summary quality assurance on the outputs, which is run after the
data are completely reduced and calibrated.  The latter final quality
assurance itself comes in several flavors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Field-by-field quality assurance using
      internal checks within a given run: <a href="./singlerunQA.html">single-run QA</a></li>
  <li>Global per-run summaries of quantities derived by single-run QA:
      <a href="summaryQA.html">summary QA</a>
  <li>Quality assurance using the overlap between adjacent runs: <em>overlap
      QA</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Since DR4, we make available the <em>single-run and summary QA</em> outputs;
since <em>overlap QA</em> may involve data which are not public yet,
we do not publish those outputs, but may do so in the future. These
pages are devoted to a detailed description of single-run QA and a
description of overall assessments of SDSS data quality.
