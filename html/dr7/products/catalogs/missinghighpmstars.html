<p>A comparison of SDSS catalogs has shown that high proper motion
stars from Sebastien Lepine's database (SUPERBLINK) are not registered
as high proper motion stars in the DR6. For those stars, the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr6/en/help/browser/description.asp?n=ProperMotions&t=U">ProperMotions
table</a> lists <var>pm</var>=0.0. The reason their motion is not
registered in DR6 is because of the incompleteness of the USNO-B
catalog, from which the DR6 proper motions are derived. Areas where
the imcompleteness is particularly severe include regions where there
are bad SERC-I or POSS-II N plates (open squares, list from
J. Munn).</p>

<p>If one tries to select off nearby stars with e.g. a
<var>pm</var>&lt;0.75 mas/yr proper motion cutoff, then the sample
will be contaminated with these &quot;<var>pm</var>=0&quot; high
proper motion stars. The plot shows the stars with
<var>pm</var>&gt;100 mas/yr, which are relatively rare, but I suspect
that a similar fraction of 10 mas/yr &lt; <var>pm</var> &lt; 100
mas/yr stars will be similarly unregistered in the DR6, which can add
up a lot of foreground contaminants.</p>

<p>At the moment, the only mitigation strategy is to avoid the regions
where contamination will be most severe.</p>
