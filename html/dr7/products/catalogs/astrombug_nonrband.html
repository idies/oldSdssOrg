<p>Astrometry for each object is referred to the reference frame of
the <var>r</var>-band images. DR1 had a bug in the reported right
ascension and declination (and all other celestial coordinates, such
as l and b) for those rare sources that are not detected in the
<var>r</var> bandÂ (for example, cool brown dwarfs and z &gt; 5.7
quasars).  This bug has been fixed in DR2 and beyond and the positions
of <var>z</var>-band only detections are now correct.</p>
