<p>Because of scattered light (see the Early Data Release paper</a> [<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123..485S">Stoughton
et al. 2002</a>]), the background sky in the SDSS images is
non-uniform on arc-minute scales.  The photometric pipeline determines
the median sky value within each 100&quot; square on a grid with
50&quot; spacing, and bilinearly interpolates this sky value to each
pixel. This biases the sky bright near large extended galaxies. As was already reported 
in the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..162...38A">Data 
Release 4 paper</a> and in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.361.1287M">
Mandelbaum et al. 2005</a>, this effect causes a systematic decrease in the number density 
of faint objects near bright galaxies. In addition, it also strongly
affects the photometry of the bright galaxies themselves, as has been
reported by <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...662..808L">Lauer et
al. (2007)</a>, <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133.1741B">Bernardi et
al. (2007)</a>, and <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...660.1186L">Lisker et
al. (2007)</a>. This effect was overestimated in Data Release 6 but has been corrected for 
Data Release 7.</p>

<p>We have quantified this effect by adding simulated galaxies with
exponential or de Vaucouleurs profiles to SDSS images. The simulated
galaxies ranged from apparent magnitude <var>m<sub>r</sub>=12</var> to
<var>m<sub>r</sub>=19</var> in half-magnitude steps, with a one-to-one 
mapping from <var>m<sub>r</sub></var> to S&eacute;rsic half-light radius 
determined using the mean observed relation between these quantities 
for Main sample galaxies with exponential and deVaucouleurs profiles.
Axis ratios of <var>0.5</var> and <var>1</var> were used, with random
position angle for the non-circular simulated galaxies.</p>

<p>Results in the <var>r</var> band are shown in the figure below, which 
shows the difference between the input magnitude and the model magnitude 
returned by the SDSS photometric pipeline as a function of r magnitude for 
galaxies with both exponential and deVaucouleurs profiles. (Figure and text from 
DR7 paper<a href="../images/index.html#footnotes">*</a>)</p>

<!--
<p>Also shown is the fractional error in the scale size
<var>r<sub>e</sub></var>.  The biases are significant to
<var>r=16</var> for late-type galaxies, and to <var>r=17.5</var> for
early-type galaxies. Also shown is the results of a separate analysis
by by Hyde & Bernardi (unpublished) who fit deVaucouleurs models to
SDSS images of extended elliptical galaxies, using their own sky
subtraction algorithm, which is less likely to overestimate the sky
level near extended sources.  Their results are quite consistent with
the simulations.</p>-->

<p style="width:640px;text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Difference between measured model and true <var>r</var>-band magnitudes of a 
series of simulated galaxies with S&eacute;rsic index of 1 (disk galaxies; upper 
panel) and 4 (elliptical galaxies; lower panel).<!-- These galaxies followed the 
magnitude-effective radius relation observed in the VAGC, and were either 
circularly symmetric (circles) or had an axis ratio of 0.5 (diamonds). They were 
added to random areas of real high-latitude fields, and run through <var>photo</var>. 
The simulated elliptical galaxies show a systematic offset even at the faint end; 
this is due to the fact that the <var>photo</var> model magnitude code assumes a 
truncation beyond 7 scale-lengths, while the "true" magnitude has no such truncation. 
This is a 0.05 mag effect.</p>-->
