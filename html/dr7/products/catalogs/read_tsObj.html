<h1>Reading SDSS object lists and checking flags</h1>

The catalogs of detected objects in the SDSS imaging data are output
in a series of so-called tsObj files.  The SDSS sky is divided up into
a series of <i>stripes</i>, overlapping great circles on the sky 2.5
degrees wide.  Each stripe is observed as a pair of <i>strips</i>,
each of which contains six <i>scanlines</i>, images in five bands from
each of the columns of CCDs in the imaging camera.  The scanlines are
13 arcmin wide, and overlap by roughly one arcminute when the two
strips of a stripe are interleaved.  Each scanline is divided up, for
processing purposes, into <i>frames</i>, consisting of 1361X2048
pixels (10'X13'), and the catalogs of objects from each frame,
together with all their attributes, are output in these tsObj files. 
<p>
  The tsObj files are fits binary tables.  One can read them using <a
  href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html">standard
FITS IO libraries</a>.  Alternatively, one can use routines in IDL,
SM, MIDAS, and IRAF to read them (see <a
href="../../tutorials/fitsfiles.html">software for reading fits files
and images</a>).  What follows is an SM implementation to read a
series of tsObj files; it should be easily translatable, e.g., into C
code.  


<p>
  Each <i>run</i> of the SDSS imaging camera is given a sequential
  number; it covers a given strip.  The correspondence between run
  number and strip number is given in
  the <a href="../../coverage/index.html#tables">SDSS coverage
  tables</a>.  A tsObj file is named by the run number, a rerun number
  (i.e., an internal processing number), the camera column number
  (i.e., which of the six scanlines), and a sequential number
  indicating the frame in question; thus:<br />
  tsObj-000756-1-20-0400.fit (run 756, camera column 1, rerun 20,
  frame 400). </p>

<p>You can search for objects and find the run, rerun, camcol, and
  field id of the fields in which they fall using
  the <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/IQS.asp">CAS
  Imaging Query Service (IQS) Form</a>.  If you have a right ascension
  and declination, you can look up the frame in which it falls
  with <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/sql.asp">CAS
  SQL</a> query. For example, this query will list the fields that
  cover RA=180.5 degrees, declination=12.0 degrees:

<br/><pre><tt>
SELECT DISTINCT f.run, f.rerun, f.camcol, f.field
FROM dbo.fGetNearbyFrameEq(180.0,12.0,23.4,0) AS nf
CROSS APPLY dbo.fCoordsFromEq(180.0,12.0) AS p
JOIN field AS f ON f.fieldID = nf.fieldID
WHERE 
   ((p.mu*f.e_r-f.b_r*p.nu-f.e_r*f.a_r+f.b_r*f.d_r)/(f.c_r*f.e_r-f.b_r*f.f_r))
     BETWEEN 0 AND 2048
 AND
   ((p.mu*f.f_r-f.c_r*p.nu-f.a_r*f.f_r+f.c_r*f.d_r)/(f.b_r*f.f_r-f.c_r*f.e_r))
     BETWEEN 0 AND 1489
</tt></pre><br/>
The 23.4 in line 3 is the distance from the center of a field to a
corner, in arcminutes. The long messy equations calculate the row and
column pixel coordinates in the field.</p>

<p>You can also use
the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/post_coords.html">DAS
coordinate lookup tool</a> to descover the run, rerun, camcol, and
field id covering a specific set of coordinates.</p>


<p>
  The full data model for the tsObj file is given in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/tsObj.html">tsObj data model</a>.  It
consists of a single HDU.  The header includes
  information on the mean seeing and sky brightness of the frame in
  all five bands, and flags indicating whether the fit to the point
  spread function was good, as well as whether the data were
  considered to be good, acceptable, bad (usually because of poor
  seeing) or hole (processing timed out, because of a very bright star
  or globular cluster).   There are roughly 2 kilobytes of attributes
  per object, as described in detail in the <a
  href="../../algorithms/edrpaper.html#sw-photo">section on the "frames"
pipeline of the EDR paper</a>.</p>

<p>We provide <a href="./read_tsObj.sm">example SM code describing
an algorithm to pull out a clean sample of stars from the data</a> (see
the <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~rhl/sm/">SM homepage</a>
if you don't have SM).  Note the extensive use of binary flag bits for
all aspects of describing the data, from labelling objects as
spectroscopic targets, to giving information on the details of the
photometric pipeline processing of the object.  Examples are given
here on reading the target flags, as well as deriving aperture
magnitudes from the data.</p>
