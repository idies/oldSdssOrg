<h1>Reading Atlas Images</h1>

<p>The atlas images are in a binary heap format that is not easily readable
by normal humans; think soft encryption.</p>

<p>We have created a standalone code that serves to both read them and as a
template library for inclusion in other codes. The code is available as: <a
href="readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz">readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>1. % make clean</p>

<p>2. % make</p>

<p>If you are on a big-endian machine, remove -DSDSS_LITTLE_ENDIAN from
CFLAGS in the Makefile.</p>

<h2>Using</h2>
<pre>% read_atlas_image -h
Usage: read_atlas_image [options] input-file row output-file
Your options are:
       -?      This message
       -b #    Set background level to #
       -c #    Use color # (0..ncolor-1; default 0)
       -h      This message
       -i      Print an ID string and exit
       -v      Turn up verbosity (repeat flag for more chatter)
</pre>

<p>If one wanted to read the r-band atlas image of an object with id=432 in
run 752, rerun 20, camcol 3, field 177, one would say:</p>
<pre>% read_atlas_image -c 2 fpAtlas-000752-3-0177.fit 432  myAtlasImage.fits</pre>

<p>where one should know the code that filters u,g,r,i,z are 0,1,2,3,4
respectively. The background level is an artifical offset added to all
pixels. The SDSS convention is 1000..</p>

<h2>Developer Comments</h2>

<p>I don't expect that many users will actually want to use the
read_atlas_image executable (although it is perfectly functional). The main
use of the product will probably be to link into custom built executables
that need to process atlas image data. I believe that the code should be
easily reused for this purpose.</p>

<p>If you look at the code you'll see that it actually manipulates a type
called an ATLAS_IMAGE.  This contains a field called a master_mask that
contains inter alia the bounding box of the atlas image ([rc]{min,max}) in
the r band, and offsets to that band (d{row,col}).</p>

<p>The standalone programmes read_mask (reads fpM files) and read_PSF (reads
psField files) are similar; all three are built by the same 'make' command.</p>
