<h2>Getting and using images</h2>

<p>The Data Archive Server provides the survey images, called
"corrected frames", as <code>fpC*.fits</code> files. See the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/fpC.html">fpC data model</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive
Server</a> serves 3-color jpeg images generated from the <var>g, r,
i</var> images as finding charts, cutouts for object lists and for
point-and-click navigation of the sky.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to get images by coordinates, or to search for
objects from the imaging and spectroscopic catalogs by redshift,
object magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve the corresponding
data from the archive.</p>

<p>There is a separate set of <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/fpAtlas.html"><code>fpAtlas*.fits</code></a>
files, containing the "postage-stamp" images for individual objects
from the <a href="../catalogs/index.html">photometric object
lists</a>. See <a href="read_atlas.html">how to read an atlas
image</a>.</p>

<h2>New for DR7: Runs and Stripe 82 Databases</h2>

<p>The DR7 <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro">Catalog Archive Server</a> contains the imaging 
RUNS database, separate from the DR7 (Legacy + SEGUE) database. This database contains 530 
imaging scans, some of which are not present in the main DR7 database, and thousands imaging
fields from the beginnings and ends of DR7 strip scans which did not resolve into a complete 
rectangular stripe on the sky.</p>
   
<p>The DR7 <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro">Catalog Archive Server</a> contains the Stripe82 
database, distinct from the DR7 and RUNS databases, containing all imaging from SDSS stripe 82 
along the Celestial Equator in the Southern Galactic Cap (<em>Stripe 82</em>). Subsets of the 303
individual stripe 82 scans were made public in previous data releases, but with DR7, we now make 
a coaddition (<em>the Stripe 82 coadd</em>) of about 47 South strip and 55 North strip scans into 
a scan in which objects are detected and cataloged about 2 magnitudes deeper than in any 
individual stripe82 scan. It includes a total of 303 runs (plus 2 coadd runs), covering any 
given piece of the  approx. 270 deg<sup>2</sup> area approximately 80 times.</p>

<p>All 303 runs covering Stripe 82 are part of the <em>Stripe 82 database</em>, which can 
be queried to search for variability (and propermotion, with a bit more effort).  Only about 
one-quarter of the Stripe 82 scans were obtained in photometric conditions, the rest were taken under
variable clouds and often poorer than normal seeing. For those runs which are non-photometric, an 
approximate calibration, using the photometric frames as reference, is derived and available in the CAS
stripe82 database, for objects with RA > 310 or RA < 59 degrees.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a name="skylev"></a><h4>Overestimation of sky levels near
      bright galaxies</h4>
<!--#include virtual="../catalogs/brightgalsky.html"--></li>

  <li><a name="badcol"></a><h4>Bad CCD columns</h4> Some chips have bad CCD columns
      which get interpolated over by the photometric pipeline, leading
      to noticeably correlated noise. The bad columns for each run are
      currently available in <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/fpM.html">fpM*.fits</a>.  These files can be
      found on the Data Archive Server in the <code>objcs</code>
      subdirectory of each <code>run/rerun</code> directory (e.g., <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/imaging/1740/40/objcs/1/">http://das.sdss.org/imaging/1740/40/objcs/1/</a>. See
      <a href="../products/images/read_mask.html">how to read fpM*.fits
      image masks</a>.</li>

      <!--#include virtual="./u_sky.html"-->
  </li>
  <li><a name="u3bad"></a><h4>u3 half-bad for runs 2188,2189,2190</h4>
		In early 2001, the u band CCD of CamCol 3 suffered
		from an electronics problem in its 'left' amplifier,
		resulting in missing u band data in half the u-band
		CCD in CamCol 3 (only) for runs 2188, 2189, 2190 (only).
		The problem was then corrected.   This data remains
		missing.  The problem can be seen by downloading
		a u3 fpC or drC corrected frame from 
		the <a href="http://das.sdss.org">DAS</a> from one of 
		these runs.  There is no work around other than
		not using the u-band data in this region.
