<p>There is a slight and only recently recognized downward bias in the
determination of the sky level in the photometry, at the level of
roughly 0.1 DN per pixel.  This is apparent if one compares
large-aperture and PSF photometry of faint stars; the bias is of order
29 mag arcsec<sup>-2</sup> in <var>r</var>.  This, together with
scattered light problems in the <var>u</var> band, can cause of order
10% errors in the <var>u</var> band Petrosian fluxes of large
galaxies.</p>
