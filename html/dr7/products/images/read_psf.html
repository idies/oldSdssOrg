<h1>Extracting PSF Images</h1>

<p>We have created a standalone code that serves to both read them and as a
template library for inclusion in other codes. The code is available as: <a
href="readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz">readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>1. % make clean</p>

<p>2. % make</p>

<p>If you are on a big-endian machine, remove -DSDSS_LITTLE_ENDIAN from
CFLAGS in the Makefile.</p>

<h2>Using</h2>
<pre>% read_PSF -h
Usage: read_PSF [options] input-file hdu output-file
Your options are:
       -?      This message
       -h      This message
       -i      Print an ID string and exit
       -v      Turn up verbosity (repeat flag for more chatter) </pre>

<p>To reconstruct the <var>z</var> PSF (i.e. the 5th HDU) at the position (row, col) =
(500, 600) from run 1336, column 2, field 51 you'd say:</p>
<pre>%  read_PSF psField-001336-2-0051.fit 5 500.0 600.0 foo.fit </pre>

<p>The desired PSF would appear as an unsigned short FITS file in foo.fit;
the background level is set to the standard `soft bias' of 1000. If you want
a floating image, change a line in the read_PSF.c; look for</p>
<pre>        /* create a float region */</pre>

<h2>Developer Comments</h2>

<p>The standalone programs read_atlas_image (reads fpAtlas files) and
read_mask (reads fpM files) are similar. All three are built by the
same 'make' command.</p>

<p>I don't expect that many users will actually want to use the
read_PSF executable (although it is perfectly functional). The main
use of the product will probably be to link into custom built executables
that need to process atlas image data. I believe that the code should be
easily reused for this purpose.</p>
