<p>The <var>u</var> filter has a natural red leak around 7100 &Aring;
which is supposed to be blocked by an interference coating.  However,
under the vacuum in the camera, the wavelength cutoff of the
interference coating has shifted redward (see the discussion in the
EDR paper), allowing some of this red leak through.  The extent of
this contamination is different for each camera column.  It is not
completely clear if the effect is deterministic; there is some
evidence that it is variable from one run to another with very similar
conditions in a given camera column.  Roughly speaking, however, this
is a 0.02 magnitude effect in the <var>u</var> magnitudes for mid-K
stars (and galaxies of similar color), increasing to 0.06 magnitude
for M0 stars (<var>r-i</var> ~ 0.5), 0.2 magnitude at <var>r-i</var> ~
1.2, and 0.3 magnitude at <var>r-i</var> = 1.5.  There is a large
dispersion in the red leak for the redder stars, caused by three
effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The differences in the detailed red
leak response from column to column, beating with the complex red
spectra of these objects.</li>
  <li>The almost certain time variability of the red leak.</li>
  <li>The red-leak images on the <var>u</var> chips are out of focus and are
      not centered at the same place as the <var>u</var> image because of
      lateral color in the optics and differential refraction - this means
      that the fraction of the red-leak flux recovered by the PSF fitting
      depends on the amount of centroid displacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make matters even more complicated, this is a <em>detector</em>
effect.  This means that it is not the real <var>i</var> and
<var>z</var> which drive the excess, but the instrumental colors
(i.e., including the effects of atmospheric extinction), so the leak
is worse at high airmass, when the true ultraviolet flux is heavily
absorbed but the infrared flux is relatively unaffected.  Given these
complications, we cannot recommend a specific correction to the
<var>u</var>-band magnitudes of red stars, and warn the user of these
data about over-interpreting results on colors involving the
<var>u</var> band for stars later than K.
