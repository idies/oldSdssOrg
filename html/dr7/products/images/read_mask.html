<h1>Extracting Mask Images</h1>

<p>We have created a standalone code that serves to both extract masks and as
a template library for inclusion in other codes. The code is available as: <a
href="readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz">readAtlasImages-v5_4_11.tar.gz.</a></p>

<h2>Compiling</h2>

<p>1. % make clean</p>

<p>2. % make</p>

<p>If you are on a big-endian machine, remove -DSDSS_LITTLE_ENDIAN from
CFLAGS in the Makefile.</p>

<h2>Using</h2>
<pre>% read_mask -h</pre>
<pre>Usage: read_mask [options] input-file hdu output-file
The HDU may be a number (&gt;= 1), or a name such as CR or INTERP
If -p is absent, the output-file will be a 8-bit FITS image;
If -p is specified, the output-file will be a list of vertices.

Your options are:
       -?      This message
       -h      This message
       -p      Calculate polygonal approximations (if so compiled)
       -i      Print an ID string and exit
       -v      Turn up verbosity (repeat flag for more chatter)
</pre>

<p>To reconstruct the z INTERP mask from run 1336, column 2, field 51 you'd
say:</p>
<pre>%  read_mask fpM-001336-z2-0051.fit 1 foo.fit </pre>

<p>The resulting file (foo.fit) would be a char FITS file, with a 1 in each
pixel that was interpolated. The bitplanes are:
 </p>
<pre>  typedef enum {
      S_MASK_INTERP = 0,           /* pixel's value has been interpolated */
      S_MASK_SATUR,                /* pixel is/was saturated  */
      S_MASK_NOTCHECKED,           /* pixel was NOT examined for an object */
      S_MASK_OBJECT,               /* pixel is part of some object */
      S_MASK_BRIGHTOBJECT,         /* pixel is part of bright object */
      S_MASK_BINOBJECT,            /* pixel is part of binned object */
      S_MASK_CATOBJECT,            /* pixel is part of a cataloged object */
      S_MASK_SUBTRACTED,           /* model has been subtracted from pixel */
      S_MASK_GHOST,                /* pixel is part of a ghost */
      S_MASK_CR,                   /* pixel is part of a cosmic ray */
      S_NMASK_TYPES                /* number of types; MUST BE LAST */
   } S_MASKTYPE;
</pre>

<p>with HDU _one_ corresponding to plane _zero_ (INTERP).  You can specify
these HDUs by name (e.g. OBJECT) or number (4).  With the -p flag, instead of
generating a FITS file, a description of each mask object as a set of convex
polygons is written in ascii to the output file; the format should be
obvious.  One caveat: the vertices of the polygons are the pixel indices, so
the boundaries pass _through_ the edge pixels, and the quoted areas are not
quite the areas of the polygons that include all of the area.  </p>

<p>The current version of this polygonal approximation code in fact generates
exactly one polygon per photo object, the convex hull. </p>

<h2>Developer Comments</h2>

<p>The standalone programs read_atlas_image (reads fpAtlas files) and
read_PSF (reads fpField files) are similar.  All three are built by
the same 'make' command.</p>

<p>I don't expect that many users will actually want to use the
read_mask executable (although it is perfectly functional). The main
use of the product will probably be to link into custom built executables
that need to process atlas image data. I believe that the code should be
easily reused for this purpose.</p>
