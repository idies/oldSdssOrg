and <EM>c</EM> is the column
location in the Imaging Array of the CCD which acquired the data (1-6).

<H2>Description</H2>
There is one bias vector per chip.  Bias vectors are determined
from calibration runs, separate from the actual data run being processed.
A bias calibration run is just a normal drift scan with the "shutter"
closed.  The bias vector is just the median over all rows in the run; i.e.,
each pixel value in the bias vector is the median value of all pixel values
along its associated column.  Overscan columns are included, and medianed the
same way as the data columns.  No other processing is done.
 <P>
When processing the data from an imaging run, the bias vectors from the most
recent bias calibration run are used.
 <P>
The pixel values are stored as unsigned integers.
The <EM>TSCALE</EM> keyword gives the amount by which each pixel value has
been multiplied; e.g., if <EM>TSCALE</EM> = 32, then each pixel value in
the image is 32 times larger than the true value.  This scaling allows us to
calculate precise values while maintaining pure integers.
