<H2>Description</H2>
All masks in one or more targetting chunks.  This file is not normally
produced, but can be produced as a convenient summary of all culled and bad
fields within a group of targetting chunks.
<p>
The target types which are culled are specified in the bit mask
<em>culled</em>, where the bits are the same as defined for the
<em>primTarget</em> fields in the <a href="tsObj.html">tsObj</a> file.
The bits associated with the <em>badMask</em> field are the same as the
<em>badMask</em> field in the <a href="tsField.html">tsField</a> file.
The field boundaries and scanline and stripe areas are for both amplifiers
together;  if the <em>badMask</em> field indicates that an amplifier is
bad, then those quantities must be adjusted accordingly.  The field boundaries
are for the scanline region mapped to this field; the primary region mapped
to this field is the intersection of the scanline region and the stripe
region (except in the south, stripe > 45, where stripe cuts are not applied).
