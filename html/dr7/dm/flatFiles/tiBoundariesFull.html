<H2>Description</H2>
As input to <em>tile</em>, a list of the boundaries for all targetting
chunks in the drilling version of the sky.  On output from <em>tile</em>,
a list of rectangles on the sky which were tiled, where each rectangle is a
piece of a targetting chunk.
<p>
The target types which are tiled are specified in the keywords
<em>primTargetMask</em> and <em>secTargetMask</em>, where the bits are the
same as defined for the <em>primTarget</em> and <em>secTarget</em> fields,
respectively, in the <a href="tsObj.html">tsObj</a> file.
