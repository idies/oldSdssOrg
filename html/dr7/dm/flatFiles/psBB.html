<EM>psBB-rrrrrr-bc-ffff.fit</EM>,
where <EM>rrrrrr</EM> is the imaging run number (of the calibration run
which produced the vector), <EM>b</EM> is the filter used (u, g, r, i, or z),
<EM>c</EM> is the column
location in the Imaging Array of the CCD which acquired the data (1-6),
and <em>ffff</em> is the file number.

<H2>Description</H2>
There is one psBB bias vector (a.k.a. "better bias") per chip per field.
The original bias vectors, idB* files, are determined from calibration runs.
Corrected bias vectors, psBB* files, are (optionally) produced by PSP which 
adds the scattered light correction to the original bias vectors.
 
The pixel values are stored as unsigned integers. The TSCALE keyword gives the
amount by which each pixel value has been multiplied;
e.g., if TSCALE = 32, then each pixel
value in the image is 32 times larger than the true value.
