<H2>Description</H2>
Nightly report of MT observations.  This file is modified by all three MT
reduction pipelines (mtframes, excal, kali), such that the qualities assigned
to individual exposures are modified to control the running of each pipeline.
The qualities stored in the OPDB reflect the qualities in the last pipeline
run stuffed into the database.

<H2>Contents</H2>
Currently, MOP has no tunable software parameters.  Thus, the value for the
"parameters" keyword should be blank.  The "telescope" keyword must be
assigned one of the values "APO20", "APO24", or "USNO40".  In the "EXP"
structure, the valid values for the "flavor" member are: "Pri", "Sec",
"Astrom", "FK5", "Focus", "Bias", "Flat", "Dark", "Man", and "Grid".
