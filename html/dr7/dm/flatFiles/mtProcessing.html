<H2>Description</H2>
A log of which frames in which nights were used to create the master
bias and flat frames for a given night's data.  Since occasionally
flats and/or biases must be copied over from other nights, a record of
both frame number and mjd is needed for the unambiguous identification
of the raw bias and flat frames.
