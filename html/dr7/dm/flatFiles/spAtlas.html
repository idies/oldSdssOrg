is the MJD of observation of the last exposure included in the 
spectro reduction, and <em>fff</em> is the fiber id.

<H2>Description</H2>
Contains the atlas images for all objects observed on a given
spectroscopic plate.
<p>

There are 10 atlas images per file. The first 5 are u,g,r,i,z,
for the best reduction. The second 5 are u,g,r,i,z for the
target reduction.  If the atlas image cannot be
read for any reason, a dummy image of size 0,0 is placed into the
fits file. If the object has run 0, as can happen for hot standars
for example, the fits file may be empty.
