<H2>Description</H2>
Photometric calibrations as a function of time.  There is one time-stamped
photometric calibration for every calibration patch intersected by the run
for which processed MT data exists.  The time-stamp indicates the time at
which the calibration patch was observed by the Imaging Camera during this
run.
<p>
The "KALXX_ID" keywords identify which secondary patches are used.  If,
for example, 3 patches were used, then the keywords "KAL01_ID", "KAL02_ID", and
"KAL03_ID" must be present.  Each such keyword identifies one patch, and should
have a value of the form "XXXXX:YYYYY", where "XXXXX" is the sequence ID for the
patch (i.e., the sequence ID recorded in the observing log for the frames from
which the data came), and "YYYYY" is the unique ID for the Kali run which
produced the calibrated data.  A sample keyword would look like:
<pre>
    KAL01_ID= '14653:1998-11-14T14:21:27 25387'

<H2>Table Header</H2>
There is one HDU of this format per file.  There is only one entry for each
calibration patch intersected by the run for which processed MT data exists.
The order of the filters in each row is the same as the order of filters in
the PDU keyword <em>FILTER</em>.
