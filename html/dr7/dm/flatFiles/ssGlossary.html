<ul>
<li>Schemata which define things
	<ul>
	<li> DEWARGEOMETRY -- where the dewars are in the focal plane
	<li> CCDGEOMETRY -- where the CCDs are in the dewars
	<li> ECALIB -- electronic properties of the CCDs
	<li> OC -- observing conditions:  seeing, extinction, ...
	</ul>
<li>Great Circle: an integer that defines which great circle to scan.
The proc inclFromStripeNumber gives you the inclination of the great circle,
and the proc stripeNumberFromEta tells you which great circle is closest
to a given eta.
<li>ins:  each great circle is covered by one stripe comprised of two strips.
ins=1 denotes the north strip and ins=2 is for the south strip.
<li>sequence (or, sometimes frame):  
the frames that fall off all the CCDs at the same time all 
have the same sequence number
<li>field: the set of frames from different CCDs that correspond to the 
same location make up a field.
<li>CCDList:  is a list of which CCDs to simulate.  This can be a set of
integers pointing to elements of the chain generated by atIcErrorLoad,
or a descriptor such as "row 1" or "col 3".  You can get the index with
the proc lookupCCD which takes camRow, camCol, and the icChain and returns
the index.
