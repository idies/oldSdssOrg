<H2>Description</H2>
This file tracks the creation of a tile through its being plugged on the
mountain as a plate.  Its created by the <em>completeTile</em> pipeline, which
assigns the final list of targets to a tile.  At this stage, the table fields
<em>xFocal</em>, <em>yFocal</em>, <em>spectrographId</em>, <em>fiberId</em>,
and <em>throughput</em> are all unset (indicating by setting their values to
-999), as are the keywords <em>plateVersion</em>, <em>plateId</em>,
<em>temp</em>, <em>haMin</em>, <em>haMax</em>, <em>mjdDesign</em>,
<em>theta</em>, <em>fscanVersion</em>, <em>fmapVersion</em>, <em>fscanMJD</em>,
<em>fscanId</em>, <em>fscanMode</em>, <em>fscanSpeed</em>,
<em>pluggers</em>, and <em>cartridgeId</em>.  The
<em>plate</em> pipeline converts the file from a tile specification file
to a plate specification file for that plate.  It fills in the values for the
table fields <em>xFocal</em> and <em>yFocal</em> (the physical location of the
hole on the plate), assigns preliminary values to <em>spectrographId</em> and
<em>fiberId</em> to assist in plugging, and adds the keywords
<em>plateVersion</em> (the version
of the plate pipeline used), <em>plateId</em> (the unique ID for
the plate), <em>temp</em>, <em>haMin</em>, <em>haMax</em>, <em>mjdDesign</em>,
and <em>theta</em> (the observing conditions for which the plate was designed).
The <em>scanner/mapper</em>  converts the file from a plate specification to a
specification for a plate plugged with a fiber harness.  It fills in values
for the table fields <em>spectrographId</em>, <em>fiberId</em>, and
<em>throughput</em> (identifying which fiber is plugged in which hole and how
much light is being transmitted through it), and adds the keywords
<em>fscanVersion</em>, <em>fmapVersion</em>, <em>fscanMJD</em>,
<em>fscanId</em>, <em>fscanMode</em>,
<em>fscanSpeed</em>, <em>pluggers</em>, and <em>cartridgeId</em>.  The
combination <em>fscanMJD</em> and <em>fscanId</em> is unique for a given
<em>plateId</em>, and uniquely identifies a mapping for a plate.
The <em>primTarget</em> and <em>secTarget</em> fields take the same value as
the same fields in the <a href="tsObj.html">tsObj</a> files (see the
description of that file for the legal values for those bit masks).
If the object was targetted in the main survey then the targetting flags
are for the main survey; in this case the highest bit in the two flags will
not be set.  If the object was not targetted in the main survey then the
target flags are for the southern survey; in this case the highest bit in the
two flags will be set.
