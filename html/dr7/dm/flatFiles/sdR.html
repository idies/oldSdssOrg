<H1>Raw Spectroscopic CCD Frame</H1>

<STRONG>File Format:</STRONG>
Non-standard FITS image (uses unsigned integers)
 <P>
<STRONG>Name:</STRONG>
<EM>sdR-cs-xxxxxxxx.fit</EM>,
where <EM>c</EM> is the camera band (b=blue,r=red), <em>s</em> is the
spectrograph (1 or 2), and
<EM>xxxxxxxx</EM> is the running (ever increasing) exposure number.
These may be kept in sync so frames from the red/blue side 1/2 instrument
have the same exposure number.
