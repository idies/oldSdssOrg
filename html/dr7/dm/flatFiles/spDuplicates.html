<H2>Description</H2>

The plPlugMapM files for a given spectro load are searched for objects
which were observed multiple times but are not of object type QA, SKY, 
REDDEN_STD, or SPECTROPHOTO_STD.  The search interval for duplicates
is +/-0.0003deg in RA and +/-0.0003deg in DEC.  The spDuplicates file
contains the results of this search.

<H2>Contents</H2>

A header and two schemas are contained within the spDuplicates file.

The header lists the following info:

  outputDir     the directory where the spDuplicates file will go
                (e.g., /data/dp3.b/data/spectro/duplicates)
  outputFile    the name of the spDuplicates file
                (e.g., spDuplicates-DR1.2002Dec18.par)
  spectro1dDir  the root directory under which the spSpec-$mjd-$plateName-$fiber.fit files sit
                (e.g., /data/dp7.a/DR1/data/spectro/1d_20)
  speclogDir    the root directory under which the plPlugMapM files sit
                (e.g., /data/dp3.b/data/spectro/speclog)
  platesDir     the directory where the plate list file sits
                (e.g., /data/dp7.a/DR1/doc/coverage)
  platesFile    the name of the plate list file
                (e.g., plateradec.dr1spectro.par)


The first schema lists the set of plates which were searched.
The schema lists the duplicate objects themselves.

<pre>
typedef struct {
    int    plate;         # plate id         | id and mjd are the 
    int    mjd;           # plate mjd        | only important entries;
    double ra;            # plate RA  [deg]  | ra, dec, and SN_gri
    double dec;           # plate DEC [deg]  | are only along for
    float  SN_gri;        # plate SN in gri  | the ride.
} PLATERADEC;

typedef struct {
    int    plate1;        # plate id of object 1 in duplicate pair
    int    mjd1;          # plate mjd of object 1 
    int    fiber1;        # fiber id of object 1
    char   objType1[20];  # object type of object 1
    int    plate2;        # plate id of object 2 in duplicate pair
    int    mjd2;          # plate mjd of object 2
    int    fiber2;        # fiber id of object 2
    char   objType2[20];  # object type of object 2
} DUPLIST;
</pre>

Note:  it is possible for there to be multiple entries for object 1
in the DUPLIST structure -- each with a different object 2 -- if
this object was observed more than twice.
