<H1>FTCL Parameter Files</H1>

Most simple ascii data files used in the Survey are formatted as
"FTCL parameter files".  This file format is described here.

Additionally, the spectro2d pipeline uses an "IDL Yanny parameter file" format
which is very nearly the same, but differs in some respects as described
below.  The IDL format may only be used for files internal to the spectro2d
pipeline.  That is, it may not be used for files used outside the spectro2d
pipeline, as IDL is not used anywhere else in the survey.

<H2>Format</H2>

FTCL parameter files contain two elements.
<dl>
<dt> Keyword/value pairs
<dd> A line may contain a keyword/value pair.  The first token is the keyword.
     The remainder of the line, up to a comment-delimiting '#' sign, is the
     value of the keyword.  In the following example, the value '51256' is
     assigned to the keyword 'MJD', and the value 'u g r i z' is assigned to
     the keyword 'filters':
<pre>
mjd	51256		# MJD day number of observations
filters u g r i z       
</pre>
<dt> Tables
<dd> Tables of data are given by first defining a C-like structure which
     defines the table format.  


     Then, any lines in the file whose first token
     is the name of the structure are considered to contain the data for a
     single entry in the table.  The tokens in each line are in the same order
     as in the structure.  Arrays are contained within '{ }' and array elements
     are whitespaced-separated.  Lines may be continued using a backslash as\
     the last character.  For example, a
     simple weather table containing four different temperatures stored as an
     array along with a single pressure, humidity, and time stamp might look
     like:
<pre>
typedef struct {
   double mjd;
   double humidity;
   double pressure;
   double temperature[4];
} WEATHER;

WEATHER 52191.300 0.23 75.21 {10.4 10.7 10.6 10.7}
WEATHER 52191.310 0.24 75.26 {10.3 10.6 10.5 10.7}
WEATHER 52191.320 0.23 75.28 {10.2 10.6 10.4 10.5}
WEATHER 52191.330 0.23 75.30 {10.2 10.5 10.3 10.3}
</pre>
</dl>

The keyword names (mjd, humidity, etc. in the above example) are case
sensitive (for the IDL format they are not case sensitive).  The data model
defines whether the variable with describes,
for example, the camera column, is camCol, CamCol, camcol, or CAMCOL. <p>

The name of the structure (WEATHER in the above example) must be in ALL CAPS
in the structure definition, but is case-insensitive in the table entries.

<pre>
	Standard datatypes are:
	char[N] - character string of length N 
			(N = length of longest char string to appear 
		       	in table +1, must be explicitly specified)
     	float - 4-byte floating-point
     	double - 8-byte floating-point
     	short - 2-byte integers		(signed short assumed)
     	int - 4-byte integers		(signed int assumed)
	enum - enumerated types         (as in the C language)
</pre>

The simple data types supported are:  int, short, double, float, and
char.  For char, you also need to specify the length (the length is ignored in
the IDL format).  
<p>

	One dimensional fixed length arrays of the above types are supported.
<p>

	For example:
<pre>
	typedef struct {
		float mag[5];
		char b[5][20];
		double c;
		int flags[2];
	} MYSTRUCT

mystruct {17.5 17.546 17.4 16.1 16.0} {the rain in "spain is" wet} 1.24345567 {123123 1231213}
mystruct {17.5 17.446 17.4 16.1 16.0} {the snow in chile "is dry"} 7.24345567 {123123 0}

</pre>

Delimiters for array dimensions may be
square ([]) brackets or, following dervish conventions, angle (<>) brackets.

<p>

A backslash (\) may be used as a line continuation character for long
table or header entries.

<p>
The  
<a href="./idReport.html">idReport</a>
files have an attribute defined in the typedef struct as:

<pre>
    char      program[20];    # Identifying name for CCD program. 
</pre>

The length of the string is defined in square brackets after the variable name.
The actual length (20 in this case) is defined by the data model for the
structure or file you are writing.  No 'program' string in the table section
of the corresponding FTCL param file in this example then
should exceed 19 characters (1 extra for the C termination).<p>

<p>
 Enums:
<p>

You may also use an enum to define an enumerated data type.  
<p>
These are similar to C-language enums, in that one lists a comma-separated
number of identifying tags in a multi-line typedef statement which 
are internally stored 
as ints, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc, but which are referenced by the tag for 
mnemonic convenience or
documentation purposes.  The tags should start with a letter,
and be alphanumeric, like a variable-name in C. 
Underscores are permitted in the tag name, i.e.  START_RUN, END_RUN.

<p>

For example, if one wants to keep track of when one is starting or
ending a series of runs in a table, you can define an enum such as 
the following at the top of the table:

<pre>
# Entry written at start or end of run
typedef enum {
        START,
        END
} RUNMARK;
</pre>

and a structure and table with the attribute defined using 
this enum looks like this:

<pre>

	typedef struct {
		int run;	      # Run number
    		RUNMARK   mark;       # Entry written at start or end of run.
		double mjd;	      # time of START or END of run
	} NEWSTRUCT;

NEWSTRUCT 712 START 51876.1 
NEWSTRUCT 712 END 51876.123

NEWSTRUCT 722 START 51878.1 
NEWSTRUCT 722 END 51879.123

</pre>

By convention enum values (i.e. START,END) are all-caps and
newlines separate the comma-separated entries in the typedef definition
of the enum.

<p>

For this example, each table entry has either <em>START</em> or
<em>END</em> for its RUNMARK field value.

The enum definition needs to appear in the file before a typedef that uses
that enumerated type.
<p>
Multiple Tables/Structures in a single FTCL file:
<p>
A given file may contain any number of keyword/value lines and any number of
tables.  
<P> 
An enum definition in a param file with multiple tables is shown here 
<a href="./idReport.html">idReport</a>

<p>
The IDL Yanny parameter format also
supports multi-dimensional arrays.  For example, an array of
strings could be defined with
<pre>
     char NAME[2][20];
</pre>
that would contain two strings, for example
<pre>
     {Eat "more bananas"}
</pre>
Since the string length is ignored in the IDL format, this could have been
defined equivalently with
<pre>
     char NAME[2][0];
</pre>

<H2>Reading and Writing</H2>
Within any FTCL-based shell, one can read an FTCL parameter file using the
command "param2Chain".  For example, to read the file '$fileName':
<pre>
ftcl> set chains [param2Chain $fileName keys]
</pre>
The keyword/value pairs will be returned as a TCLX keyed list in the variable
"keys".  Each table will be read into a DERVISH chain.  The list of chains is
returned by the command as a TCL list.
<p>
Say we have a TCLX keyed list stored in the variable "keys", and two chains
with the handles "h1" and "h2" that we wish to write to an FTCL parameter file
named "$outFileName""
<pre>
ftcl> chain2Param $outFile "h1 h2" keys
</pre>
Both commands have various options to control how the files are read and
written.  See their documentation for more details.
<p>
For reading and writing IDL Yanny parameter files, one can
use the routines YANNY_WRITE, YANNY_READ, YANNY_PAR.  The format
allows one to loss-lessly switch between IDL structures,
FITS binary tables and IDL Yanny parameter files.
<p>
One can also read FTCL parameter files with these same IDL routines,
except that the case-sensitivity to element names is lost.
The two structures in an sdReport file can be read with:
<pre>
     IDL> yanny_read, 'sdReport-52059.par', a, hdr=hdr
</pre>
   The structure formats could be viewed with
<pre>
     IDL> help, *a[0], /structure
     IDL> help, *a[1], /structure
</pre>
   The MJD's in the SEXP structure can be printed with
<pre>
     IDL> print, (*a[0]).mjd
</pre>
   An keyword from the header can be retrieved with
<pre>
     IDL> print, yanny_par(hdr, 'equinox')
</pre>

<h2> Caveats </h2>
<ol>
<li>If the last character in a string is a quoted double quote, it is chopped off by param2Chain.</li>
<li>Quoting characters, i.e. '\' (backslash characters), in strings are not
removed in param2Chain when quoting a double quote.</li>
</ol>
