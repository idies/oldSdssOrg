<H2>Description</H2>
Lists the set of MT primary fields to be observed by each telescope.
A primary field may contain several primary stars.  Thus, the preferred 
pointing of the telescope is not necessarily the coordinates of a given 
primary star.  The coordinates given in this file will tend to maximize 
the number of neighboring primary stars obtained within the telescope's 
field-of-view for a given pointing for a given primary star.
