<H2>Description</H2>
Measured solution for position of chips in main imaging camera,
their rotation angles and scale changes, along with overall telescope scale
and each dewars' scale, position and rotation.  This file is generated by a
special calibration (for example, by scanning through one of the astrometric
calibration fields), on a periodic basis (for example, anytime a dewar is
removed from the camera).  All quantities are for unbinned pixels.
