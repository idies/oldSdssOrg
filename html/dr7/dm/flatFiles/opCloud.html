The statistics from the all-sky cloud camera for a single night.  Each set
of statistics is for the distribution of counts (units for counts are
arbitrary) in the central 100x100 region of a single cloud camera image after
flattening, noisefixing, etc.  Each set is timestamped with the time the
data was obtained.
