<H2>Description</H2>

<h3>DR1 fpBIN files (photo v5_3)</h3>

A 4x4 binned version of the corrected image after sky-subtraction.
The counts in each binned pixel are the average of the counts in its
associated 16 unbinned pixels after a global sky and scattering wings
of stars have been subtracted (<code>fpC</code> and <code>fpBIN</code>
header keyword <code>SKY</code>), scaled up a factor of
<code>BINFAC</code> (== 2^<code>SHIFTED</code>), with
<code>SOFTBIAS</code> added afterwards.  All pixels that are in atlas
images are replaced by the background level before binning and sky
subtraction, with suitable noise added.  All of the header parameters
from the raw image are inherited as well.

<h3>EDR fpBIN files (photo v5_2)</h3>
A 4x4 binned version of the corrected image.  The counts in each binned pixel
are the average of the counts in its associated 16 unbinned pixels, scaled up
a factor of BINFAC (== 2^SHIFTED).  All pixels that are in atlas images are
replaced by the background level before binning, with suitable noise added.
All of the header parameters from the raw image are inherited as well.
