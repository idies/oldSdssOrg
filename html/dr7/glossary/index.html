<a name="asinh"></a>

<h3>asinh magnitude</h3> 
Magnitudes within the SDSS are expressed as inverse 
hyperbolic sine (or ``asinh'') magnitudes, sometimes referred to informally as <em>luptitudes</em> .
The transformation from linear flux measurements to asinh magnitudes
is designed to be virtually identical to the standard astronomical
magnitude at high signal-to-noise ratio, but to switch over to linear behavior at low S/N and even at negative values of flux,
where the logarithm in the <a href="#mag_pogson">Pogson magnitude</a> fails.  Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages, or the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v118n3/990094/990094.html">Lupton et al. 1999 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="astrans"></a>

<h3>asTrans file</h3>
FITS binary table with astrometric transformations for every field in a single imaging run. It transforms frame (row,col) coordinates to great circle (mu,nu) coordinates for a given inclination. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

<a name="Astrda"></a>

<h3>AstroDA</h3>
The data acquisition and analysis system used to collect data from the survey telescope cameras.

<a name="Astrom"></a>

<h3>Astrom</h3>
The data processing pipeline that maps CCD pixel coordinates to celestial coordinates. The detailed workings of this pipeline are described in the <a href="../algorithms/astrometry.html">Astrometry</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>, or the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v125n3/202156/202156.html">Pier et al. 2003 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="astrom_chip"></a>

<h3>astrometric chip</h3>The SDSS <a href="#camera">camera</a>
contains 24 2048x400 pixel CCDs (in addition to the 30 2048x2048
photometric CCDs) which are used for astrometry and focus
monitoring. Because they are smaller chips, the effective exposure
time is only 11 seconds, allowing the survey to observe brighter stars
without saturation. These bright star positions are necessary to match
to objects present in astrometric catalogs used by the <a
href="#Astrom">Astrom pipeline</a>. For more details on these chips,
please see the appropriate section of the <a
href="../instruments/imager/index.html">camera pages</a> or the AJ
imaging camera paper (<a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v116n6/980260/980260.html"
target="new">Gunn et al. 1998</a>).

<a name="astrometry"></a>

<a name="atlas_image"></a>

<h3>atlas image</h3>
For each detected <a href="#object">object</a>, the atlas image
comprises the pixels that were detected as part of the object in any
filter. These are available through the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>, as a 
single file for each field.

<a name="B"></a>
<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
<h3><u>B</u></h3>

<a name="best"></a>

<h3>Best</h3>

We maintain multiple versions of the SDSS imaging data set. The
<b>Best</b> version contains the images and photometric catalogs with
the highest quality data at the time of the data release. The <a
href="#target">target</a> version contains those data at the time the
target selection algorithm was run for that part of the sky.  For
example, the DR1 "best" data set contained better data for some parts
of the sky than the DR1 "target" data set (including most of the EDR
data set).
<!-- If newer data of -->
<!-- better quality becomes available for a piece of sky (specifically, if -->
<!-- a <a href="#chunk">chunk</a> is newly <a -->
<!-- href="#resolve">resolved</a>), the old data is removed from this -->
<!-- database and replaced. Therefore, this database is <em>not</em> -->
<!-- static. In general, we plan to update this database every few -->
<!-- months. For the DR1-beta, the contents of this database are -->
<!-- fixed, -->
<!-- however. -->

<a name="binned_frame"></a>

<h3>binned frame</h3>
Each file is a FITS image for one filter, 512 x 372 pixels, with WCS information. These are the <a href="#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a> with detected objects removed and binned 4 pixels by 4 pixels. All pixels that are in <a href="#atlas_image">atlas images</a> are replaced by the background level before binning, with suitable noise added. All of the header parameters from the original image are inherited as well. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

<a name="blackbook"></a>

<h3>Black Book</h3> This document provides a description of the
original science goals of the survey, as well as the hardware and
software designs, and was the 1996 proposal to NASA. Please keep in
mind that it is <em>not</em> updated, so information within it may no
longer be current. Nevertheless, it provides an excellent overview of
the survey. The science content of this proposal is available online
in the <a
href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/PBOOK/welcome.htm">Project
Book</a>.

<a name="boresight"></a>

<h3>boresight</h3>
The telescope control computer keeps track
of a specific point in the telescope focal plane that is called the <b>boresight</b>. The boresight is not fixed in the array but is at one of two
places for the two <a href="#strip">strips</a> that compose a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. It is the boresight that will track <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circles</a>. Technically, the boresight tracks a path that is a great circle in J2000 coordinates as viewed from the solar system barycenter.

<a name="C"></a>
<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
<h3><u>C</u></h3>

<a name="calibration"></a>

<h3>calibration</h3>
The process by which the photometric and spectroscopic observations are calibrated. The goal of calibration is to take the digital camera readouts and convert them to measured quantities like fluxes. The details of these procedures can be found on the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="camcol"></a>

<h3>camcol</h3>
A Camcol is the output of one camera column of CCD's (each with a different filter) as part of a <a href="#run">Run</a>. Therefore, 1 Camcol = 1/6 of a Run. It is also a portion of a <a href="#scanline">scanline</a>.

<a name="camera"></a>

<h3>camera</h3>

The instrument used for imaging. It consists of 30 photometric and 24
astrometric CCDs (see <a
href="../instruments/imager/index.html">camera description</a>).  The
camera is a mosaic of 54 CCD detectors in the focal plane, 30 large
devices arranged in 6 columns of 5 each and 24 smaller devices around
the periphery. See this <a href="../shared_images/camera.gif">sketch
of the camera focal plane</a> or this <a
href="../shared_images/camopen.jpg">real life image</a>. The camera is
described in detail in the imaging camera paper (<a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v116n6/980260/980260.html"
target="new">Gunn et al. 1998</a>).


<a name="CAS"></a>

<h3>CAS (Catalog Archive Server)</h3>

The <a href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a>
is a searchable database that contains the measured parameters from all objects in the imaging
survey and the spectroscopic survey. 

<a name="casjobs"></a>

<h3>CasJobs</h3>
A batch (asynchronous) interface to the <a href="#cas">CAS</a> for querying the database and 
storing results. CasJobs is designed to handle especially long or otherwise demanding queies.

<a name="caveats"></a>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
Also known as "known problems."  SDSS maintains a list of issues which are potentially 
troublesome but for which we have devised workarounds. 


<a name="central_meridian"></a>

<h3>central meridian</h3>
The meridian which passes through the center of the survey area, 12h 20m , defines the central meridian of a scan. The great
circle perpendicular to it passing through the survey center at <img src="../shared_images/delta.gif">=32.8deg is the <a href="#survey_equator">survey equator</a>. 

<a name="child"></a>

<h3>child</h3>
A product of the <a href="#deblend">deblending</a> process. When two objects are near each other on the sky, their images may appear merged. The deblender tries to split this merged image; the resulting sub-images are called children. The initial merged image is called a <a href="#parent">parent</a>. For more details, see the <a href="../algorithms/deblend.html">Deblending</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="chunk"></a>

<h3>chunk</h3>

A chunk is a piece of sky composed of a set of touching but non-overlapping primary
<a href="#segment">segments</a> (or parts of segments) of individual runs which fills a
"chunk" of a <a href="#stave">stave</a>, and is therefore bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant <a href="#mu">mu</a>, and
north-south by lines of constant <a href="#eta">eta</a> (if in the
North). Southern chunks have no eta boundary applied.  A chunk may
also have a <a href="#lambda ">lambda</a> cut if it is at the end of
the survey region for that stripe. Chunks do not overlap, so the union
of all existing chunks represents the unique sky coverage for the
survey at any given time. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure explaining the SDSS survey
geometry</a> for details. Note that the bounds on chunks, if using
mu/eta, are a mix of <a href="#survey_coords">survey coordinates</a>
and <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle
coordinates</a>. <b>Note:</b> The term chunk has sometimes been used
to describe an area of sky that has had <a href="#tiling">tiling</a>
run on it. This is properly called a <a href="#tile_region">tiled
region</a>.

<a name="classification"></a>

<h3>classification (photometric)</h3>
The method by which we assign a type (star or galaxy) to each <a href="#object">object</a>. The details of this procedure are described in the <a href="../algorithms/classify.html">Classification</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="cloud_cam"></a>

<h3>Cloud Camera</h3>
A camera at the mountain that takes continuous pictures
of the sky at 10 microns, a wavelength at which clouds emit.
It is a sensitive measure of the photometricity of the sky as a
function of time. 

<a name="CMM"></a>

<h3>CMM</h3>

of holes in the <a href="#fiber">fiber</a> mount <a
href="#plate">plates</a> for the spectrographic survey.

<h3>Cmodel magnitude</h3>

Composite model magnitude. See <a href="#mag_cmodel">magnitude,
cmodel</a>.

<a name="chunk"></a>

<h3>convex</h3>
A convex is the intersection of one or more circles, with a depth (the number of circles 
involved). If we have two intersection circles, A and B, then both (A) and (B) are a convex 
of depth 1, their intersection (A)(B) is also a convex, but of depth 2. We call these simple 
convexes "wedges."

<a name="coordinates"></a>
<h3>coordinates</h3>
The SDSS uses three different coordinate systems. We use
standard astronomical right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec),
J2000. There is also the <em><a href="#survey_coords">survey
coordinate system</a></em>, with coordinates <a href="#lambda">lambda
(<IMG SRC="../shared_images/lambda.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&lambda;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a> and <a href="#eta">eta (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/eta.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&eta;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a>. This is just a rotation of the usual RA, Dec
system. Finally, there is the <em><a href="#great_circle_coords">great
circle coordinate system</a></em>, which is actually a separate
coordinate system for each <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. The
coordinates of this system are <a href="#mu">mu (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/mu.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&mu;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a> and <a href="#nu">nu (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/nu.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&nu;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a>.

<a name="corrected_frame"></a>

<h3>corrected frame</h3>
Each corrected frame is a FITS image for one filter, 2048 columns by 1489 rows, with row number increasing in the scan direction. These are the imaging frames with flat-field, bias, cosmic-ray, and pixel-defect corrections applied. A raw image contains 1361 rows, and a corrected frame has the first 128 rows of the following corrected frame appended to it. The pixels subtend 0".396 square on the sky. Header information using the <a href="#wcs">world coordinate system (WCS)</a> allows standard astronomical FITS tools to convert pixel position to right ascension and declination. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

spectroscopic products of the survey. We also provide <a
href="../access/index.html">descriptions of the DAS data access
tools</a>.

<a name="data_model"></a>

<h3>data model</h3>
The description of the structure and organization of the data in a database. The data model tells you all the tables names, their contents, and how they are related to, and linked with, one another. The actual implementation of a data model is called the database schema. For the flat files available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>, the data models are available <a href="../dm/flatFiles/FILES.html">here</a>.

<a name="deblend"></a>

<h3>deblend</h3>
Deblending is the process by which overlapping objects in images are separated. The <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a> attempts to determine whether each object actually consists of
more than one object projected on the sky and, if so, to deblend such a <a href="#parent">parent</a> object into its constituent <a href="#child">children</a>, self-consistently across the bands (thus, all children have measurements in all bands). For details on how this works, and what <a href="#flag">flags</a> this procedure may set, see the <a href="../algorithms/deblend.html">Deblending</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="Dervish"></a>

<h3>Dervish</h3>
An <a href="#FNAL">FNAL</a> software toolkit used by many of the data acquisition and reduction systems. 

<a name="dev"></a>

<h3>deVaucouleurs</h3>
Also know as the r<sup>1/4</sup> law, it describes the radial light profile of a typical elliptical galaxy. Defined as<br><b>I(r) = I<sub>0</sub>exp{-7.67[(r/r<sub>e</sub>)<sup>1/4</sup>]}</b>. An elliptical version of this profile is fit to every detected object, yielding the <code>deV</code> parameters. See the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">model magnitude section of the photometry algorithm page</a> for details. 

<a name="DR1"></a>

<h3>DR1...7</h3> Data Release 1 through 7, the formal periodic releases of SDSS data to the public. A small portion of the data was
released as part of the <a href="#EDR">Early Data Release
(EDR)</a>.  The data releases are cumulative: later releases include more recent data and re-processed older data.  Thus DR7, the final release, is the definitive version. 
Each Data Release is associated with a journal article that describes changes from the previous release. 

<a name="E"></a>
<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
<h3><u>E</u></h3>

<a name="eclass"></a>

<h3>eClass</h3>
A value between -1 and +1 assigned by the spectro1d pipeline to each spectrum, derived from 
principal component vectors. In general, spectra with lower-temperature absorption features 
have more negative eClass, and spectra with higher temperature features or emission lines have 
more positive eClass.

<a name="EDR"></a>

<h3>EDR</h3>

Early Data Release. The first public release of SDSS data occurred in
June of 2001. The EDR is described in the <a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n1/201415/201415.html">EDR
paper on the AJ web site</a>, also available as <a
href="../algorithms/edrpaper.html">EDR paper in HTML</a>.

<a name="ellipticity"></a>

<li>the <a href="#adaptive_moment">adaptive moments</a></li>
<li>the <a href="#dev">De Vaucouleurs profiles</a></li>
<li>the <a href="#exp">exponential profiles</a></li>
<li>the isophotal parameters</li>
</ul>

<h3>eta</h3>
Latitude in the <a href="#survey_coords">survey coordinate system</a>. Eta is the angle between the survey equator and the great circle passing through the point perpendicular to the survey meridian, positive to the north.
Constant latitude curves are great circles

<a name="exp"></a>

<h3>exponential model</h3>
The radial light distribution of a disk galaxy can often be fit by an exponential profile:<br>
<b>I(r) = I<sub>0</sub>exp(-1.68r/r<sub>e</sub>)</b><br>
The number 1.68 is chosen so that the
model radius is a half-light radius. An elliptical version of
this profile is fit to every detected object, yielding the <code>exp</code> parameters. See the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">model magnitude section of the photometry algorithm page</a> for details. 

<a name="extra_plates"></a>

<h3>extra plates</h3>
Reobservations of main survey plates, useful for variability studies or checks. See the 
<a href="../coverage/">Sky Coverage</a> page for more information.

<h3><u>F</u></h3>

<a name="false"></a>

<h3>False color pipeline</h3>
A  pipeline to produce 3-color JPG files of 
zoomed-down SDSS images.  

<a name="family_objects"></a>

<h3>family objects</h3>
These are objects that are generated when photometric objects are neither primary nor secondary 
survey objects but a composite object that has been <a href="#deblend">deblended</a> or the part 
of an object that has been deblended wrongfully (like the spiral arms of a galaxy). These objects 
are kept to track how the deblender is working.

<a name="fiber"></a>

<h3>fiber</h3>
The SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light from individual objects to the slithead. Each object is assigned a corresponding <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">fiberID</b></font>. The fibers are 3 arcsec in diameter in the source plane. Each fiber is surrounded by a large sheath which prevents any pair of fibers from being placed closer than 55 arcsec on the same <a href="#plate"> plate</a>.


<h3>fiberMag</h3>
The magnitude measured by the frames pipeline to simulate the flux that would fall into a fiber in typical seeing. See <a href="#mag_fiber">Magnitude, fiber</a>. 

<a name="field"></a>
<h3>field</h3>

A field is a part of a <a href="#camcol">camcol</a> that is processed
by the <a href="#photo">Photo pipeline</a> at one time. Fields are
2048x1489 pixels; a field consists of the <a href="#frame">frames</a>
in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky. Fields overlap each
other by 128 rows; <a href="#primary">primaries</a> are decided when
<a href="#chunk">Chunks</a> are <a href="#resolve">resolved</a> (using
objects between rows 64 and1425 as primaries). A field at the edge of
a Chunk may in fact be included in two (or more) Chunks. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure explaining SDSS field
geometry</a> for details.

<a name="filter"></a>

<h3>filter</h3>
The SDSS uses five filters: <em>u,g,r,i,z</em> to restrict the light reaching each CCD to only certain wavelengths (or colors).  
Please read the <a href="../instruments/imager/index.html">Camera Page</a> for details. Term is used to describe both the physical 
filter and to tag parameters as measured through that filter. 

<a name="FITS"></a>

<h3>FITS</h3>
The Flexible Image Transport System, a standard method of storing astonomical data. The FITS format has a <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">home page</a>.

<a name="flag"></a>

<h3>flag</h3>
A bitmask used in the database to specify various properties of an object. There are many flags in the SDSS catalogs such as whether the object was <a href="#deblend">deblended</a> or saturated, for instance. There are
   status flags set by PSP, and by survey operations, on a
   frame-by-frame basis, describing the quality of the PSF, and the
   quality of the data overall.  Each object is given status flags
   that sort out overlaps.  The spectra have flags at two levels
   as well: pixel-by-pixel flags, and warning flags accompanying the
   redshifts and classification to indicate trouble.
For more help with flags, see the <a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">Flags Help Page</a>.

<a name="frame"></a>

<h3>frame</h3>
The data stream from a single CCD in a scanline is cut into a series of frames which measure 2048 x 1489 pixels and overlap 10% with the adjacent frame. The frames in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky are called a <a href="#field">field</a>. 

<a name="frames_pipeline"></a>

     This yields <a href="#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a>.  Then objects are found by running a
     PSF-matched filter over the image, and matched between the
     five frames making up a field.  A <a href="#deblend">deblender</a> is run to resolve
     overlaps, and the properties of each object are written to the
     <a name="#fpObjc">fpObjc</a> files.  Atlas images are written to the <a name="#fpAtlas">fpAtlas</a> files.

<a name="fundamental_standard"></a>

One of the two main coordinate systems 
utilized by the SDSS. In this system, <a href="#mu">mu</a> and <a href="#nu">nu</a> are spherical coordinates (corresponding to ra and dec) in a system whose equator is along the center of the <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> in question. The stripes of the survey are great circles which all cross at (RA, Dec) = (95, 0). The stripes are defined by their inclination with respect to the equator, and are indexed by integers <em>n</em> such that the inclination of a stripe is -25 + 2.5<em>n</em>. Thus, stripe <em>n</em>=10 corresponds to the Equator. The design is that the area covered by the imaging on a given stripe (the so-called OK_SCANLINE area in the north) is a 2.5 degree wide rectangle centered on nu=0 in Great Circle coordinates.

<a name="The Hammer"></a>
<h3>The Hammer</h3>

The Hammer is the name of a piece of code developed by the University of
Washington red star analysis team to provide accurate spectral types
and other information for red stars (generally redder than spectral type K,
extending through types M,  L and T).  The spectral type classifier
output of the Hammer is provided in the sppParams table of the DR7 CAS
for each star in the database.  The Hammer provides the best classification
information for redder stars.

<a name="maggie"></a>

<h3>maggie</h3>
A <em>maggie</em> is a linear
measure of flux; one maggie has an AB magnitude of 0 (thus a surface
brightness of 20 mag/square arcsec corresponds to 10<sup>-8</sup> maggies
per square arcsec). This unit is used for object <a href="#profile">radial profiles</a>, where we provide the azimuthally averaged object surface brightness in a series of annuli.

<a name="mag_cmodel"></a>
<h3>magnitude, cmodel</h3>

Composite model magnitude. The magnitude obtained from the
best-fitting linear combination of the best-fitting de Vaucouleurs and
exponential model for an object's light profile (cf. <a
href="#mag_model">magnitude, model</a>). See <a
href="../algorithms/photometry.html#cmodel">cmodel magnitude
description</a> in Photometry section of the Algorithms pages.

<a name="mag_fiber"></a>
<h3>magnitude, fiber</h3>
The flux contained within the aperture of a <a href="#fiber">spectroscopic fiber</a>
(3" in diameter) is calculated by the frames pipeline in each band and stored in <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">
fiberMag</b></font>. Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_fiber">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages.
<br>

<a name="mag_model"></a>

<h3>magnitude, model</h3>
Just as the <a href="#mag_psf">PSF magnitudes</a> are optimal measures of the fluxes of
stars, the optimal measure of the flux of a galaxy would use a matched galaxy
model.  With this in mind, the code fits two models to the
two-dimensional image of each object in each band:<br>
1. a pure deVaucouleurs profile, and<br>
2. a pure exponential profile.<br>
The best-fit model in the
  r-band is fit to the other four bands; the results are stored as the
  model magnitudes. 
Details, <font color="red"> including a very important warning</a></font>, can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages.

<a name="mag_petro"></a>

<h3>magnitude, Petrosian</h3>
Stored as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroMag</b></font>. For galaxy photometry, measuring flux is more difficult than for stars, because galaxies do not all have the same radial surface
brightness profile, and have no sharp edges.  In order to avoid
biases, we wish to measure a constant fraction of the total light,
independent of the position and distance of the object. To satisfy these
requirements, the SDSS has adopted a modified form of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1976ApJ...209L...1P&db_key=AST&high=3d6550d53612836">Petrosian (1976)</a> system, measuring galaxy fluxes within a circular
aperture whose radius is defined by the shape of the azimuthally
averaged light profile.
Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_petro">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages and the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v124n3/202037/202037.html">Strauss et al. 2002 AJ paper</a> on galaxy target selection.

<a name="mag_pogson"></a>

<h3>magnitude, Pogson</h3> The Pogson magnitude is the standard
astronomical magnitude system, where one increment in magnitude is an
increase in brightness by the fifth root of 100.  A star of 1st
magnitude is therefore 100 times as bright as a star of 6th
magnitude. That is, for two objects <br> <code>M1 - M2 =
-2.5log(F1/F2)</code><br> where M1 and M2 are the magnitudes of two
objects, and F1 and F2 are their luminous fluxes.

<a name="mag_psf"></a>

<h3>magnitude, PSF</h3>
Stored as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">psfMag</b></font>. For isolated stars, which are well-described by the point spread function 
(PSF), the optimal
measure of the total flux is determined by fitting a PSF model to the
object.  Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_psf">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages.

<a name="mask"></a>

<h3>mask</h3>
Regions of data that are excluded from analysis. For example, some wavelength regions in the

so are masked out, and some parts of the sky (e.g. around bright stars) may be masked.

<a name="mask_frame"></a>

<a name="parent"></a>

<h3>parent</h3>
A product of the <a href="#deblend">deblending</a> process. When two objects are near each other on the sky, their images may appear merged. The deblender tries to split this merged image; the initial merged image is called a parent, while the resulting sub-images are called <a href="#child">children</a>.

One of the institutions involved in the survey. These institutions have contributed hardware, software, manpower, or financial support to the survey, and thus have pre-public access to data.

<a name="petromag"></a>

<h3>petroMag</h3>

<a name="petrorad"></a>

<h3>petroRad</h3>

Units are seconds of arc. The Petrosian radius (and related measures of size called petroR50 
and PetroR90) are derived from the surface brightness profile of the galaxy, as described 
in <a href="../algorithms/">Algorithms</a>. 

<a name="photo"></a>

<h3>Photometric Pipeline (<code>Photo</code>)</h3>
A series of linked pipelines (<a href="#ssc">Serial Stamp Collecting pipeline, SSC</a>; <a href="#psp">Postage Stamp Pipeline, PSP</a>, and
 <a href="#frames_pipeline">Frames</a>) which analyze the raw image data, including bias
   subtraction, sky and PSF determination, flat-fielding, and finding
   and measuring the properties of objects.  The astrometric and
   photometric calibration is carried out with the <a href="#Astrom">astrometric
   pipeline</a> and <a href="#nfcalib">nfCalib</a>. 

<a name="photo_tel"></a>

<h3>Photometric Telescope</h3> Also abbreviated PT. A 0.5-meter
telescope used for monitoring the transmission of the atmosphere during
the course of the survey. Its principal function is to aid 
in accurately calibrating an object's brightness as measured with the
main 2.5-m telescope. See the <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/tour/photo_telescope.html">PT web
page</a> for more details.

<a name="phototag"></a>

<h3>photoTag</h3>
A table that includes only the most frequently accessed PhotoObj columns. GalaxyTag and StarTag are 
views of PhotoTag that contain only Primary extended images and point-like images, respectively. 
None of these tables and views contain spectroscopic information. 

<a name="photoz"></a>

<h3>photoZ</h3>
The photometric redshift. The measured colors of galaxies and quasars are observed to depend on 
their redshift.  This enables a technique called "photometric redshifts" whereby the redshift 
can be estimated from the measured colors, in the absence of a spectrum. Photometric redshifts 
have larger random and systematic errors than spectroscopic redshifts, but they can be obtained 
for fainter and thus many more galaxies and quasars. 

<a name="plate"></a>

<h3>plate</h3>
Each spectroscopic exposure employs a large, thin, circular metal plate that positions the 
fibers via holes drilled at the locations of the images in the telescope focal plane. Each plate 
has a unique serial number, which is called plate in views such as SpecObj.

<a name="plate_map"></a>

<h3>plate mapper</h3>
An instrument that maps which plugged <a href="#fiber">fiber</a> corresponds to which target object. The 640 fibers of the <a href="#spectrograph">spectrograph</a> are placed by hand without regard to which fiber corresponds to which position. An automated fiber mapper resolves this object-to-fiber match-up by scanning lasers across the terminal ends of the fibers and observing where they ``light up'' on the focal plane. 

<a name="poles"></a>

<h3>poles</h3>
SDSS uses a number of coordinate systems to describe positions on the sky. These are spherical polar 
coordinates, where great circles are lines of longitude that converge at the poles. Specifying the 
location of the poles on the sky is part of the definition of the coordinate system. 

<a name="psf"></a>

<h3>Point Spread Function (PSF)</h3>
The detailed shape of the response of the
telescope plus instrument to a star.  It varies with position, filter,
and time, due to changes in the atmosphere and the optics of the
telescope.  It is calculated by the <a href="#psp">PSP</a>.

<!-- <a name="poles"></a> -->

<!-- <h3>poles</h3> -->

<a name="psp"></a>

<h3>Postage Stamp pipeline (PSP)</h3>
This pipeline determines for a <a href="#run">run</a>
   the background sky, the flat-field, and the spatially varying Point
   Spread Function (PSF) in each CCD, all of which will be used by
   the <a href="#frames_pipeline">Frames pipeline</a>.

<a name="primary"></a>

<h3>Primary (object)</h3>
The ``main'' observation of an object. Because there are overlaps at many levels of the imaging (<a href="#run">runs</a>, <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>), an object may be observed two or more times. Whether or not a specific observation of an object is the primary is 
decided when <a href="#chunk">chunks</a> are <a href="#resolve">resolved</a>. Whether an object is primary or not depends on a large number of factors.

<!-- Is it in the primary area of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>, also known as a <a href="#stave">stave</a>? This implies the object has the OK_STRIPE flag set. <p> -->

<a name="primary_standard"></a>

<h3>primary standard</h3>
One of the 158 stars on the SDSS photometric
  system that is observed by the PT to measure the extinction of a
  given night, and which is used to calibrate the magnitudes of the
  secondary standards.  The primary standard system is described
  in the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n4/201445/201445.html"> Smith et al. 2002 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="profile"></a>

<h3>profile</h3>
An azimuthally-averaged radial
surface brightness profile. In the catalogs, it is given as the
average surface brightness in a series of annuli.  This quantity is in 
units of <a href="#maggie">maggies</a> per square arcsec. The number of annuli for which there is a
measurable signal is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> nprof</b></font>, the mean surface
brightness is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profMean</b></font>, and the error is listed as
<b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profErr</b></font>.  This error includes both photon noise, and the
small-scale ``bumpiness'' in the counts as a function of azimuthal
angle.

When converting the <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">profMean</b></font> values to a local surface
brightness, it is <b>not</b> the best approach to assign the mean
surface brightness to some radius within the annulus and then linearly
interpolate between radial bins.  Do not use smoothing
splines, as they will not go through the points in the cumulative
profile and thus (obviously) will not conserve flux. What <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a>
does, e.g., in determining the <a href="#mag_petro">Petrosian ratio</a>, is to fit a taut spline to the
<em>cumulative</em> profile and then differentiate that spline fit,
after transforming both the radii and cumulative profiles with asinh
functions.  We recommend doing the same here.
<br>
The annuli used are provided in <a href="profile_table.html">this table</a>.

<a name="QA"></a>

<h3>Quality Assurance (QA)</h3>
Generally speaking, the process by which data
are confirmed to be of survey quality.  Each pipeline carries out QA,
whose results are available for examination. After
the imaging data are calibrated, they are run through a comprehensive
set of tests (runQA) that confirm that the various photometric
measures are consistent, and that, e.g., the <a href="#zhed">Zhed point</a> is
well-behaved.  Overlap QA looks for consistency in the photometry and
astrometry of objects in overlaps between adjacent <a href="#scanline">scanlines</a> and <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>.

<a name="quasar"></a>

<h3>quasar</h3>
The spectro1d pipeline classifies some objects as "quasars" (e.g. as labeled at the bottom of the 
gif plot). Objects are classified as quasars by the spectro1d pipeline if it detects an emission 
line wider than 1000 km/sec (full-width at half-maximum). The Early Data Release paper gives a more complete 
description of the classification process (but is outdated in that the EDR paper describes 
a selection based on a full-width at half-maximum of only 500 km/sec).

<h3>rerun</h3>
A reprocessing of an imaging <a href="#run">run</a>. The underlying imaging data are the same, just the software version and calibration may have changed.

<a name="resolve"></a>

<h3>resolve</h3>
A term describing the assignments of subsets of data (<a href="#field">fields</a>, <a href="#segment">segments</a>, <a href="#run">runs</a>) to fill a <a href="#chunk">chunk</a>. A chunk is "resolved" when there are sufficient data to fill a contiguous length of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. At that time, decisions are made on the best data to use (seeing, photometric conditions) to fill the desired area. A chunk can be resolved multiple times, as new data are acquired or data are reprocessed (see <a href="#target">Target</a> and <a href="#best">Best</a>)
 
<a name="run"></a>

<h3>Run</h3> A Run is a length of a <a href="#strip">strip</a>
observed in a single continuous observing scan, bounded by lines of <a href="#mu">mu</a> and <a
href="#nu">nu</a>. A strip covers a great circle region from pole to
pole; this cannot be observed in one pass. The fraction of a strip
observed at one time (limited by observing conditions) is a Run. Runs
can (and usually do) overlap at the ends. Like strips, it takes a pair
of runs to fill in a length of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>.  This
is why you may read about data taken from "Runs 752/756" or some
similar terminology. Each individual run contains 6 <a
href="#camcol">camcols</a> spanning the same range of nu, but not
delimited by <a href="#eta">eta</a>. These run pairs might not have
the same starting and ending <a href="#nu">nu</a> coordinates. See

<a name="runs_database"></a>

<h3>Runs database</h3>
A database accessible via the <a href="#cas">CAS</a> that contains photometric catalog parameters 
derived from all <a href="run">runs</a>, not just runs with quality sufficiently good to

<h3><u>S</u></h3>

<!-- <a name="scan"></a> -->

<!-- <h3>scan</h3> -->

<a name="scanline"></a>

<h3>scanline</h3>
A subdivision of a <a href="#strip">strip</a>. Each strip is covered by 6 "scanlines".  Scanlines are defined in
<a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle coordinates</a>. The great circle coordinate
system is different for each strip, and is defined by setting the
equator of the coordinate system to be the center line of constant eta
for the <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> to which the strip belongs.  A scanline is then bounded on the top and bottom by
lines of constant <a href="#nu">nu</a>, with no east or west boundaries. 
Scanlines touch but don't overlap, and thus are a unique mapping on the
sky for that stripe only.  Scanlines for different stripes DO overlap. This is because the scanlines come from the camera columns, or <a href="#camcol">camcols</a>, which 
have a fixed physical width, while the spherical coordinates converge at the poles. See this <a href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for details. <b>Note:</b> The term scanline has been used interchangeably (and improperly) with <a href="#camcol">camcol</a>.

<a name="sdssqa"></a>

<h3>sdssQA</h3>The SDSS Query Analyzer. A Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the functionality necessary for SDSS users to prepare and submit queries to the SQL server database.

<a name="sdssqt"></a>

<h3>sdssQT</h3>
Obsolete. This was the SDSS Query Tool, used for the <a href="#edr">Early Data Release</a>. It is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides the functionality necessary for SDSS users to prepare and submit queries to the Science Archive, the 'end product' of the SDSS, where all publicly available scientific data products are stored and
ready for access. 

<a name="secondary_object"></a>

<h3>secondary object</h3>
The best observation of an object with multiple observation is called the <a href="#primary">primary 
object</a>, and other observations are stored in the PhotoObjAll table and PhotoObj view as 
secondary objects.

<a name="secondary_patch"></a>

<h3>secondary patch</h3>
The <a href="#photo_tel">PT</a> observes a series of
  secondary patches on a given night, calibrated to the system of
  <a href="#primary_standard">primary standards</a>.  These patches overlap the 2.5m survey <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>;  with the photometry determined for these, we can set the zeropoints
  of the 2.5m <a href="#run">runs</a>. 

<a name="sector"></a>

<h3>sector</h3>
A sector is basically an intersection of <a href="#tile_regions">TileRegions</a>. It is a plate wedge 
modified by intersections with overlapping <a href="#tile_boundaries">tile boundaries</a>. 
If the <a href="#tiling_boundary">TilingBoundary</a> regions are complex (multiple <a href="#convex">convexes</a>) 
or if they are holes (isMask=1), then the resulting sector is also complex (a region of multiple 
convexes). As such, a sector is just a single convex. Tiling boundaries do not add any depth to 
the sectors; they just truncate them to fit in the boundary.

<a name="segment"></a>

<h3>segment</h3>

A segment is a piece of a given <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames</a> pipeline
reduction (<a href="#run">run</a>/<a href="#run">rerun</a>/<a
href="#camcol">camcol</a>), covering a piece of a <a
href="#scanline">scanline</a>, bounded on the east and west by lines
of constant <a href="#mu">mu</a>.  Because segments are defined before
the <a href="#primary">primary</a> area of a <a
href="#stripe">stripe</a>, segments can actually go beyond the <a
href="#eta">eta</a> limits of a <a href="#stave">stave</a> (and a <a
href="#chunk">chunk</a>). Indeed, near the very end of a stripe (near
the poles), a segment may fall completely outside a stave. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for details.


<a name="segue"></a>

<h3>SEGUE</h3>
The <a href="../../segue/">
Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration</a>
mines the stellar content of the Milky Way in order to create a
detailed 3-dimensional map of the Galaxy.
SEGUE obtained 3500 square degrees of new imaging data, including scans at low Galactic latitude.  SEGUE obtained spectra of 240,000 stars in the disk and spheroid,
revealing the age, composition and phase-space distribution of stars within the
various Galactic components.
These stellar excavations provide essential clues for understanding the structure,
formation and evolution of our Galaxy.

redshifts. The operational goals of the 1D SPECTRO pipeline are:
<OL>
<LI>To fit the continuum of the spectrum.
<LI>To determine an emission-line redshift and identify all detected emission
lines.  A flag will also be set to identify any expected emission
lines (on the basis of the spectral classification) which were not seen.
<LI>To classify the spectrum by cross-correlating with a set of
template spectra ranging from
stars to quasars.  A principal component
analysis similar to that of Connolly et al. (1995)

<h3>Spec2D</h3>
The first half of the spectroscopic pipeline (also sometimes referred
to as idlspec2d), which reduces the raw 2D spectral frames to 1D calibrated
spectra (flux versus wavelength). The operational goals of the 2D SPECTRO pipeline are:
<OL>
<LI>To interpolate over bad pixels
<LI>To mask all bad pixels and pixels contaminated by strong sky emission.
<LI>To bias and dark subtract the raw 2D data frames
<LI>To trim the frame
<LI>To flat-field  using calibration frames taken at
the same telescope pointing position before and after an exposure
on the sky.
<LI>To optimally extract 1D spectra from this 2D frame.
<LI>To apply wavelength calibration, rebin to a common
wavelength solution, and sky subtract. 
<LI>To coadd the three or more individual exposures for each
object. 
<LI>To put the red and blue halves of the spectrum together.
<LI>To flux calibrate the spectrum to obtain 
spectrophotometry good to roughly 15%, using the measured photometry
of spectrophotometric standards on each plate.

A pipeline called the 'SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline' (sspp) computes standard stellar atmospheric 
parameters such as [Fe/H], log g and Teff for each star by a variety of methods. These outputs are 
stored in the CAS in a table called 'sppParams', indexed on the 'specObjID' key index parameter for 
queries joining to other tables such as specobjall and photoobjall.

<a name="spPlate"></a>

page</a>.

<a name="SSPP"></a>

<h3>SSPP</h3>  The <a href="http://../../segue/stellarpars.html">SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline</a>,
is the union of a set of techniques gathered together in one
set of pipeline for measuring common stellar atmospheric parameters
(namely metallicity, effective temperature and surface gravity) for
stars based on medium resolution (R ~ 2000) spectra of the stars,
combined with accurate stellar photometry.  This pipeline yields Teff, [Fe/H] ([M/H]), and log g measurements
for all stars of sufficient S/N (generally better than 10 or 15 for bluer stars).  The results are available in the CAS in the sppParams table.

<a name="stave"></a>

<h3>stave</h3>
A unique region of sky, bounded by two lines of constant <a href="#eta">eta</a>. A stave is a portion of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> that is tapered near the poles so that it does not overlap with the neighboring stave. This term is used analogously to the meaning of stave in barrelmaking.

<a name="stokes"></a>

<h3>Stokes Parameters</h3> 
These quantities are related to object ellipticities.  Define the flux-weighted second moments of the object as:<br>
<b>M<sub>xx</sub> = &lt;x<sup></sup>/r<sup>2</sup>&gt; ,M<sub>yy</sub> = &lt;y<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup>&gt; , M<sub>xy</sub> = &lt;xy/r<sup>2</sup>&gt;</b><br>
In the case that the object's isophotes are self-similar ellipses, one can show that: <br>
<b>Q = M<sub>xx</sub>-M<sub>yy</sub> = [(a-b)/(a+b)]&times;cos2<img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"> <br> U = M<sub>xy</sub> = [(a-b)/(a+b)]&times;sin2<img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"></b><br>
where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes and <img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"> is the position angle. Q and U are <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">Q</b></font> and <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">U</b></font> in the table
<b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">PhotoObj</b></font> and are referred to as "Stokes parameters." They can be used to reconstruct the axis ratio and position
angle, measured relative to row and column of the CCDs. This is equivalent to the normal definition of position
angle (east of north), for the scans on the equator. The performance of the Stokes parameters are not ideal at low
signal-to-noise ratio, in which case the <a href="#adaptive_moment">adaptive moments</a> will be more useful.

<a name="strip"></a>

<h3>strip</h3>

A strip is a scan along a line of constant survey latitude <a
href="#eta">eta</a>. The center of a stripe is set at a given eta;
centers of strips have a <a href="#boresight">boresight</a> offset
added. Because the columns of CCDs have gaps between them, it is
necessary to take two offset but overlapping observations to fill in a
<a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. These two scans are called strips, one North and one South. Note
that while strips are centered on a given eta, THEY ARE NOT BOUND BY
ETA LINES. Thus they are rectangular regions and can overlap at the
poles. See this <a href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for
details.

<a name="stripe"></a>

<h3>stripe</h3> Stripes are the sum of two strips, defined in <a
href="#survey_coords">survey coordinates</a> (<a
href="#lambda">lambda</a>, <a href="#eta">eta</a>).  A "stripe" is
defined by a line of constant eta, bounded on the north and south by
the edges of the two strips that make up the stripe, and bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant lambda. Because both strips and
stripes are defined in "observed" space, they are rectangular areas
which overlap as one approaches the poles. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for
details. <b>NOTE</b>: You may see the term stripe used to mean an area
bounded by eta lines, which would be a unique part of the sky. That is
a common use of the term, as some of the target selection
documentation uses it that way. The proper (and relatively new) term
for the unique, eta-bound portion of a stripe is a <em><a
href="#stave">stave</a></em>.

<a name="stripe_82_coadd"></a>

<h3>stripe 82 coadd</h3>
An SDSS data product that sums (i.e., co-adds) individual pixels from the photometric sections of 
runs on Stripe 82. There are two coadds: one for the North strip and one for the South strip. 
These co-added runs were processed via the photometric pipeline to produce catalog values for 
objects that go much deeper than the individual runs. Thus "Stripe 82 coadd" can also refer to 
the catalog values as well as to the pixels. 

<a name="stripe_82_database"></a>

<h3>stripe 82 database</h3>
The Stripe 82 database, accessible via the <a href="#cas">CAS</a>, includes the Stripe 82 coadds 
as well as all runs ever obtained on Stripe 82. Runs obtained earlier than 2004 were in photometric 
conditions and were part of the Southern Survey. More recent runs were for the Supernova Survey 
and have a faster cadence, but were often obtained in non-photometric conditions, or with Moon, 
or with poor seeing. All of the runs have been calibrated in a uniform way, although the 
non-photometric runs will of course have larger errors.

<a name="surface_brightness"></a>

<h3>surface brightness</h3>
The <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a> also reports the radii containing 50% and 90% of the <a href="#mag_petro">Petrosian flux</a> for each band, <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR50</b></font> and <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR90</b></font> respectively. The usual
characterization of surface-brightness in the target selection pipeline of the SDSS is the mean surface brightness within petroR50. 
<br>
It turns out that the ratio of petroR50 to petroR90, the so-called ``inverse concentration index'', is correlated with morphology (Shimasaku et al. 2001,
Strateva et al. 2001). Galaxies with a de Vaucouleurs profile have an inverse concentration index of around 0.3; exponential galaxies have an inverse
concentration index of around 0.43. Thus, this parameter can be used as a simple morphological classifier. 
<br>
An important caveat when using these quantities is that they are not corrected for seeing. This causes the surface brightness to be underestimated, and
the inverse concentration index to be overestimated, for objects of size comparable to the PSF. The amplitudes of these effects are not yet well
characterized. 

<a name="supernova_campaign"></a>

<h3>supernova campaign</h3>
One of the three observing seasons for the Supernova survey, namely September through November of 
2005, 2006, and 2007.  Some test data were also obtained in Fall of 2004. 

<a name="supernova_stripe"></a>

<h3>supernova stripe</h3>
Stripe 82, the celestial equatorial stripe that is visible in the Fall and observed in each 
Supernova campaign. (In practice the Supernova data extend slightly beyond the formal definition 
of Stripe 82, comprising in total 120 degrees from RA = 20h to RA = 4h.)

<a name="survey_coords"></a>

<h3>survey coordinates</h3>
One of the two main coordinate systems used by the 
survey, with coordinates <a href="#eta">eta</a> and <a href="#lambda">lambda</a>. 
This is simply another spherical coordinate system, where (eta,lambda)=(0,90.) corresponds to (ra,dec)=(275.,0.) and (eta,lambda)=(57.5,0.) corresponds to 
(ra,dec)=(0.,90.). Note also that at (eta, lambda)=(0.,0.), 
(ra,dec)=(185.,32.5). So, this is a pure rotation of the usual RA/Dec system, as opposed to the <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle system</a>, which is defined relative to each individual <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>.
For some reason, although "eta" is constant along great 
circles, it is referred to as "survey latitude," while "lambda" is referred to
 as "survey longitude." Also, "eta" runs only from -90. to 90.; the back of 
the sphere is covered by "lambda", which runs from -180. to 180. The Survey 
coordinates are defined such that the "primary" area of a <a href="#stripe">
stripe</a> (otherwise known as a <a href="#stave">stave</a>) in the north 
is defined by a rectangle in Survey coordinates which is 2.5 degrees wide in 
eta (coordinate width). <!--  You may be interested in SM routines which convert  -->
<!--  between Equatorial, Survey, and Great Circle coordinates, but we won't -->
<!--  tell you where you get them.XXX -->

<a name="survey_equator"></a>

<h3>survey equator</h3>
The great circle perpendicular to the <a href="#central_meridian">central meridian</a>,  passing through the survey center at delta=32.8deg is the survey equator. 

<a name="survey_poles"></a>

<h3>survey poles</h3>The locations of the poles in the <a href="#survey_coords">survey coordinate system</a>. Due to the unusual nature of this system, there is an east pole and a west one, at delta = 0 , alpha = 18h 20m and 6h 20m. 

<a name="sx"></a>

<a name="table"></a>

<h3>Table</h3> 
A specific set of objects and their measured quantities stored in a database.

<a name="target"></a>

<h3>Target</h3>

<b>1.</b> An object selected as a candidate for spectroscopy.<br>
<b>2.</b> The pipeline used to select candidate for spectroscopy (also called the TS pipeline). The
procedures and various type of targets are described in the <a
href="../algorithms/target.html">the Target algorithm page</a>. <br>
<b>3.</b>The version of the data set containing photometric
measurements for objects at the time <a
href="../algorithms/target.html"><code>Target</code></a> was run. If
newer observations or improved calibration or software becomes
available, the imaging data may be reprocessed, but <em>not</em>
re-<code>Target</code>ed. The improved photometry is provided in the
separate <a href="#best"><code>Best</code> data set</a>.

<a name="target_selection"></a>

<h3>target selection</h3>
A general term used to describe how objects are selected for spectroscopic observation. A priori, 
one has only the photometric parameters, thus the "target selection algorithm" gives the rules 
whereby a statistically complete sample of galaxies, quasars, or stars is selected within each 
tile on the sky. 

<a name="tdi"></a>

<h3>TDI</h3>
The SDSS imaging data are taken in time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) mode at the sidereal rate almost simultaneously in five bands. The sky tracks through 5 CCD detectors in succession, each located behind a different filter. See <a href="../shared_images/camera.gif">this image</a> to get a better idea.

<a name="tilable"></a>

<h3>tilable target</h3> These are spectroscopic <a href="#target"> target</a>s which are assigned to <a href="#tile"> tile</a>s by <a href="#tiling"> tiling</a>. The significance of this is that tilable targets are supposed to have as close to uniform completeness as possible and it should be possible to define well-defined samples of such targets. The bitmasks <b>primTarget</b> and <b>secTarget</b> described in <a href="../algorithms/target.html"> the description of the target selection</a> contain the target assignments of each <a href="#object"> object</a>. Tilable targets for the survey proper are those with the <b>primTarget</b> flags QSO_HIZ, QSO_CAP, QSO_SKIRT, QSO_FIRST_CAP, QSO_FIRST_SKIRT, GALAXY_RED, GALAXY, GALAXY_BIG, GALAXY_BRIGHT_CORE, or STAR_BROWN_DWARF, and those with the <b>secTarget</b> flag HOT_STD.

<a name="tile"></a>

<h3>tile</h3>
A 1.49 deg radius circle on the sky determined by <a href="#tiling">tiling</a> and which contains the locations of up to 592 <a href="#tilable"> tilable target</a>s and other science targets. For each tile one or more <a href="#plate"> plate</a>s will be created. If less than the maximum of 592 <a href="#tilable"> tilable targets</a> can be assigned to that tile, the spare fibers are assigned to other spectroscopic targets. The 48 remaining <a href="#fiber"> fiber</a>s are assigned to calibration targets. 

<a name="tile_region"></a>

<h3>tiled region</h3>
TileRegion is a term used to indicate the portion of a <a href="#tile">Tile</a> that may have <a href="#target">targets</a> 
(i.e. within the union of the <a href="#tiling_boundary">TilingBoundaries</a> for a <a href="#tile_run">TileRun</a> 
and outside the union of the <a href="#tiling_mask">TilingMasks</a> for the TileRun and the global 
TilingMasks). These are not necessarily convex, because of the TilingMasks.

<a name="tile_run"></a>

<h3>tile run</h3>
A TileRun represents a single run of the tiling software. It is a logical unit of geometrical 
information that consists of a set of <a href="#tiling_boundary">TilingBoundaries</a>, 
<a href="#tiling_mask">TilingMasks</a>, and <a href="#tile">Tiles</a> that are associated with 
exactly one TileRun (ie each TilingBoundary, TilingMask, and Tile is associated with exactly 
one TileRun, with one exception that will be noted later). Sometimes this is also called a 
tiling chunk, although that is incorrect usage of the term and it should not be confused with 
an imaging chunk.

<a name="tiling"></a>

<h3>tiling</h3>
The process of designing <a href="#tile">tiles</a> for spectroscopy. 

<a name="tiling_boundary"></a>

<h3>tiling boundary</h3>
A TilingBoundary is a set of "rectangles" that defines the area of the sky that may be tiled in a 
<a href="#tile_run">TileRun</a>. Only <a href="#target">targets</a> from within the union of the 
<a href="#tiling_boundary">TilingBoundaries</a> for a TileRun may be assigned to Tiles created 
during a TileRun. A single TilingBoundary must be contained within a single chunk.

<a name="#tiling_mask"></a>

<h3>tiling mask</h3>
TilingMasks are "rectangles" that should not be considered part of the tileable area 
during a <a href="#tile_run">TileRun</a>.

<h3>Ubercal</h3>
Ubercal is a method of recalibrating the SDSS Imaging survey,
using a 'global' rather than a 'local' (scan-by-scan), technique
of solving for zeropoints and extinction for each camera-column 
for each run.  It makes heavy use of overlapping 'crossing scans',
which run at an oblique angle to the standard survey stripes and
yield multiple detections of the same stars in different camera columns.
Application of the Ubercal techniques suggests that
the overall scatter in the photometry of the survey can be reduced
from about 2% rms in the gri bands down to 1% rms.  The Ubercal outputs are available for the whole
of the Main survey imaging footprint in the CAS.  They are
available as both offsets from the standard SDSS photometry and
as stand-alone magnitudes for each primary object.

<h3>View</h3>
In a database, a way of looking at a subset of the data in a given <a href="#table">Table</a>. Views are treated just like Tables in <a href="#sql">SQL</a> queries. For example, in the <a href="#CAS">CAS</a>, the Galaxy view shows only the subset of PhotoObj table that are morphologically classified as galaxies.

<h3>zConf</h3>
Literally the confidence that the redshift is correct, zConf is more broadly a measure of the 
likelihood that the spectral template (and thus spectral classification and redshift) is correct. 
Except for intrinsically featureless spectra, it is generally correlated with the signal-to-noise 
ratio in the spectrum.

<h3>zhed point</h3>
   The stellar locus in SDSS color-color space is essentially
    one-dimensional.  Various canonical positions in color-color space
    can be defined from bends in the stellar locus; we call these
    positions the Zhed Points.  The constancy of these positions (after correcting for reddening) is a
    very useful test of the uniformity of our photometry.

<h3>zStatus</h3>
The adopted redshift (the spectroscopic parameter z) may be determined by one of a number of 
algorithms, and it can be manually overridden in problematic cases. The zStatus flag encodes which 
method was actually used.
