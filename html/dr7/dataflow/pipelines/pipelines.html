<h2>The pipelines</h2>
<p>Each of the operating steps is actually a collection of algorithms run in
pipelines producing a number of data products. Here, we give a brief
description of what is contained in these steps, together with links to more
detailed explanations. Again, refer to descriptions of the <a
href="../../catalog/index.html" target="_parent">Catalog Archive Server
contents</a> and the <a href="../../data/index.html" target="_parent">Data
Archive Server contents</a> as well as <a href="../../algorithms/index.html"
target="_parent">details of our algorithms</a> elsewhere.</p>

<h3><a href="./mtpipe.html">Photometric Telescope (PT) / Monitoring Telescope
(MT) pipeline</a></h3>

<p>The photometric telescope (PT) has two main functions: it measures
the atmospheric extinction on each clear night based on observations
of primary standards at a variety of air masses, and it calibrates
secondary patches in order to determine the photometric zero point of
the 2.5 m imaging scans. The monitor telescope pipeline (<a
href="./mtpipe.html"><code>mtpipe</code></a>), so called for
historical reasons, processes the PT data.</p>

<h3><a href="./photo.html">Imaging pipelines</a></h3>

<p>The imaging pipelines include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the astrometric pipeline <code>astrom</code>, which performs the astrometric calibration</li>
  <li>the <code>photo</code> pipeline, consisting of two components:
      <ol>
	<li>the postage stamp pipeline <code>psp</code>, which
	    characterizes the behavior of the point-spread function as a function
	    of time and location in the focal plane</li>
	<li>the <code>frames</code> pipeline, which finds, deblends,
	    and measures the properties of objects</li>
      </ol>
  </li>
  <li>the final calibration pipeline <code>nfcalib</code> which applies the
      photometric calibration to the objects</li>
</ul>
