<h1>Rsync Help for SDSS DAS Users</h1>

<p>Users of the SDSS Data Archive Server (DAS) may use <em>rsync</em>,
an open source utility that provides fast incremental file
transfer. Rsync is available for download at
the <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/">rsync website</a>. (Note
that <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> and other
http-based mass download tools can be used to accomplish the same
task, as described on the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/collab">DAS
homepage</a>.) Here we provide detailed instructions for installation
and use of rsync on a variety of platforms.</p>

<p>The same instructions apply for mirroring all or parts of the data
archive server through each of the rsync URLs
<ul>
<li><code>rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/imaging</code></li>
<li><code>rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/spectro</code></li>
<li><code>rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/pt</code></li>
<li><code>rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/nightly</code></li>
<li><code>rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/unprocessed</code></li>
</ul>
with password <code>sdss</code>.</p>

<a name="unix"> <h2>BSD/Unix/Linux</h2>

<p>Rsync is often installed by default on BSD/Unix/Linux systems. It
is included in Mac OS X, for instance. If it is not installed on your
system, or you would like to upgrade to the latest version, you can
find links to the <a
href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/download.html">available
downloads</a>. We recommend downloading and compiling the source,
rather than retrieving the binary. </p>

<p> The source can be downloaded directly from the <a
href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/ftp/rsync/">rsync download area</a>. You
will need to gunzip and untar the file if your browser does not do so
automatically. A directory called rsync-2.5.6 is created; just
<em>cd</em> into that directory, and execute<br>
<em>./configure</em><br> This will create a Makefile and config.h
appropriate for your system. Then type<br> <em>make</em><br> to
compile the code. Finally, to put rsync in your path, either add it by
hand, or type<br> <em>make install</em>.</p>

<p>At this point, you are ready to use rsync. You can use <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/collab">DAS access page</a> to generate a
  file that can be used by rsync to download the data set you can
  specify:
<ol>
<li>Follow the "Upload a user generated list of spectroscopic fibers"
  or "Upload a user generated list of imaging fields" depending on
  whether you want spectroscopic or imaging data.</li>
<li>Select a data release and supply a table describing the data you
  want, as instructed on the form.</li>
<li>Follow the "this form" link in the "Download selection" section
  of the resultant page.</li>
<li>Select the filters (for imaging) and file types you want, and
  check "rsync" for the download method.</li>
<li>Submit the form, and save the result. The default name of the
  saved file will be of the form <b>sdss-rsync-XXXXX.lis</b>.</li>
</ol>
This file contains a listing of all the data files to be pulled
over by rsync. Then, change the working directory to where you want
the downloaded directory tree to be placed and execute
<br> <code>rsync
-vtrLPRH --copy-unsafe-links --include-from=sdss-rsync-XXXXX.lis
rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/imaging/ ./ </code><br>
or
<br> <code>rsync
-vtrLPRH --copy-unsafe-links --include-from=sdss-rsync-XXXXX.lis
rsync://user@rsync.sdss.org/spectro/ ./ </code><br>
to retrieve your
files. (If you use rsync for mirroring the archive, you can create
your own include file, or point rsync directly to a specific directory
if only one directory is to be downloaded.) You will be prompted for a
password, which is dr7. If you will
be downloading often, you can set an environment variable of this
password by adding<br>
<code>setenv RSYNC_PASSWORD XXXX</code><br> to your .cshrc file, or
<br> <code>export RSYNC_PASSWORD=XXXX</code><br> to your .bashrc
file.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b>If you are behind a firewall, you will need to<br>
<code>setenv RSYNC_PROXY host:port</code><br> (or the equivalent
<code>export</code> in non-csh-like shells) to point to your
institution's proxy server and port number.</p>

<a name="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Windows users cannot download and run rsync directly. You will
first have to install <b>cygwin</b>, a linux emulator. It works with
all non-beta, non "release candidate", ix86 versions of Windows since
Windows 95, with the exception of Windows CE. Cygwin is available for
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">download here</a>, free of charge.
Click on the "Install Now" link, and a file called <b>setup.exe</b>
will be downloaded. Running this will allow you to install
Cygwin. </p>

<p> Because <b>rsync</b> is not included with Cygwin, you
will also need to download and install rsync. Use your web browser to
<a
href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/ftp/rsync/">download
the rsync source code</a>. Open a Cygwin session, <em>cd</em> to the
location of the source, and follow <a href="#unix">the instructions in
the Unix section above</a> to install rsync.</p>

<a name="mac">
<h2>Macintosh</h2>

<p>Mac users with OSX can follow <a href="#unix">the instructions in
the Unix section above</a> to download and install rsync. Users with
OS9.x will unfortunately not be able to use this utility.</p>
