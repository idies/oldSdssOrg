<h3>Report on 2dF/SDSS collaborative project</h3>
<p>
In 2000 the CoCo approved a collaborative project between SDSS astronomers at JHU
and 2dF astronomers at the AAO, to follow-up with the 4m AAT high-redshift QSO 
and galaxy candidates selected to the limit of SDSS imaging. The project was 
approved for a trial phase.
<p>
The trial phase has now ended, after a very successful run of AAT Director's nights
in July 2001 we finally have a decent set of data with very encouraging results.
We are now seeking confirmation that we can proceed with this project for further
allocations of 2dF time over the next 3 years.

<h3>Brief Description of the project and current status</h3>
<p>
Our primary science goal is selecting QSOs currently missed by the SDSS bright
survey by (i) going to fainter mag limits, and (ii) cutting closer to
the stellar locus. The latter is particularly interesting as at z=3 the QSO
locus is very close to the stellar locus, and is difficult to separate even
with full ugriz data, and this is the redshift at which QSO activity peaks
in the Universe. In fact standard SDSS targeting explicitly
avoids this redshift range because of the selection problems.
<p>
At z>5 there is a similar problem, the QSO track passes close to the late M, L, T
sequence and can only be distinguished with further IR colors.
<p>
With a dedicated 2dF survey one has the potential to follow-up large numbers of
candidates even with a low success rate, due to the availability of 400 fibers.
2dF is also interesting because one has the option to put red AND blue gratings
in the two spectrographs and send 200 candidates to each, corresponding to
z~3 and z~5 candidates. This makes the survey particularly efficient as it
well matches the density of candidates. (We note however that it was non-trivial 
to adapt the fiber allocation software to cope with this, and we spend 
considerable effort on this).
<p>
In July we had a very successful 2 night run. We observed a total of 13 fields
(3750 objects) with 1.5 hour exposures. The spectra easily reach i=21. We found
a total of 50, z~3 QSOs and 3 z>4.5 QSOs including another addition to the z>5
bestiary. This gives a 2.5<z<3 QSO number density of ~2 per deg^2, which is 
approximately a 10x fold increase relative to the SDSS results in this redshift bin!
In fact our number of z=3 QSOs achieved in only 2 nights is comparable to all those
ever measured before. At z=5 we have an advantage over previous work in that
we are not selecting on JHK photometry to distingush from late stars, rather
we are simply hitting everything. There is the potential here to determine the
number of dusty red QSOs at high-redshift.
<p>
We attach some sample spectra, it can be seen that although the 2.5<z<3 range
is difficult to identity photometrically it is very easy to identify SPECTROSCOPICALLY
due to the prominent LyA/CIV features.
<p>
In addition to targeting QSOs beyond the SDSS main survey limits we are doing the
same with galaxies with unusual colors. The idea is to search for potential lensed
high-z galaxies - counterparts to objects such as MS1512-CB58 (z=3, R=20.5, 
Pettini et al 2001). About 10 galaxies per 2dF field are targeted. Our results
here are less clear, our galaxy search has revealed a couple of tantalizing
spectra, however at S/N=3 absorption line identification is difficult and
we need to follow up our best candidates with longer spectra elsewhere before 
we can be sure.
<p>
<h3>What we are now seeking from CoCo</h3>
<p>
Approval for the people listed above to continue with this 2dF project for the next
3 years. We wish to apply for 12 nights of 2dF time a year, which would result
(allowing for weather) in 500 2.5<z<3 QSOs and at least 30 z>4.5 objects.
This would allow detect determination of the QSO LF at the epoch of their
peak. The potential for serendipitous discovery of unusual high-z objects is
also great.
