I am currently finishing my dissertation at the University of Washington, 
under the supervision of Julianne Dalcanton, and I will be moving to a 
postdoctoral fellowship at NYU on November 1st, 2003. I would like to 
request external collaborator status  to continue the work I have begun in 
my SDSS  dissertation.  I have also begun working on several refinements to the 
project, in collaboration with Julianne Dalcanton and Connie Rockosi, and 
would like external collaboration status for this extension as well.
 
For my dissertation, I have designed a survey for resolved Milky Way 
satellite galaxies and applied it to DR1.  The 
scientific significance of this project is a strong function of the 
area of sky I am able to survey, and requires more area than available in 
DR1 to make substantive conclusions.  Because of the specialized software 
that I have and the unique skill set I have developed, my continued effort 
in the analysis of the SDSS data would be beneficial to the 
collaboration, particularly in assessing the uniformity of photometry and 
star-galaxy separation.

I also request permission to refine the work begun in my 
dissertation.  I have begun collaborating with Connie Rockosi (currently a 
postdoc at UW) to combine the matched CMD technique she developed for 
tracing the tidal tails of Palomar 5 with the spatial filtering technique 
used in my dissertation for resolved Milky Way satellites.  We would like  
to use CMD templates with a range of ages and metallicities, and projected 
to a range of distances, to search for outer halo substructure.  This 
technique may be sensitive to the types of substructure that Newberg et al 
02, Yanny et al 03 have detected, but at distances that are larger than 
can be probed with their techniques based on blue horizontal branch 
stars.
 
Thank you for your time,
Beth Willman
