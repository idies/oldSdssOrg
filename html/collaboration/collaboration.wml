<h1>Collaboration Affairs</h1>

<p><img src="$(ROOT)/photos/95_1591CN.web1.jpg" align="right"
alt="1994 Collaboration meeting at Yerkes">The Collaboration consists of
about 150 scientists at the <a
href="$(ROOT)/members/index.html">Participating Institutions</a>.
Its membership also includes scientists from non-participating
institutions who have earned data access through their contributions to
SDSS infrastructure.  In addition its membership includes external
collaborators who provide expertise on specific projects.  The size of
the Collaboration is about 200 Ph.D. scientists.</p>

<p>The Collaboration provides an opportunity for its members to exchange
information and ideas freely, thereby assisting the pursuit of their
individual research goals.  Collaboration Affairs is the organization
for accomplishing these goals.  Collaboration Affairs consists of the
Collaboration Council, the Working Groups, and the Publications
Office.</p>

<h3>Scientific Spokesperson</h3>

<p>The Director has delegated the management of Collaboration Affairs to
the Scientific Spokesperson.  He has also delegated to the Spokesperson
the primary responsibilities for representing the Survey to the
scientific community and for raising the visibility of the Survey within
the astronomy and physics communities.</p>

<h3>Collaboration Council</h3>

<p>The Spokesperson has established a Collaboration Council (CoCo) to
help manage the affairs of the collaboration.  It includes a formal
channel to the Director and the Advisory Council for addressing the
issues of the Collaboration that requires their action.  The CoCo
consists of one representative from each SDSS institution, and one At
Large member to represent the external participants.  Each SDSS
institutional representative to CoCo is appointed by its scientific
member of the Advisory Council.  The At Large member is chosen by the
Spokesperson in consultation with the CoCo.  The Chair of the CoCo is
appointed by the Spokesperson and reports to the Spokesperson.  The CoCo
provides advice on all Collaboration matters to the Spokesperson
including recommendations for policies on publications, scientific
representation, and science projects.</p>

<p>The CoCo is responsible for reviewing proposals for <a
href="../policies/ext_coll.html">science projects which include external
collaborators</a>, scientists who may be given limited access to SDSS
data for specific projects. A list of approved projects with External
Collaborators can be found <a href="approved_ext_coll.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Working Groups and Key Projects</h3>

<p>Working Groups have been formed to address the following specific
topics:
<ul>
<li>large scale structure
<li>clusters
<li>galaxies
<li>quasars
<li>stars
<li>serendipity
<li>southern survey
<li>reddening
<li>solar system
</ul>
One function of these Working Groups is to define <a
href="key_projects.html">Key Projects</a> which together define the Core
Program of the SDSS.</p>

<p>The WG's are to consider the complete flow of data relevant to each
WG from the CCD's through calibration to final publication.  The WG's
will assist the Director in defining scientific requirements for
equipment, observing time, calibration and analysis software, and data
storage and distribution.  These requirements will be considered by the
Project Scientist in formulating recommendations to the Director in the
same categories.</p>

<p>Each WG Chair is appointed by the Director for a fixed term.  New
WG's may be formed and existing WG's may be disbanded only after
approval of a written plan by the Director.</p>
