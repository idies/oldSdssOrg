1 Introduction</A>
</H1>
This document outlines the top-level scientific requirements
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and describes how these requirements
can be tested and monitored during the scientific commissioning and 
operations.  For each requirement, its scientific basis is
given (and whenever appropriate, a reference is given as well).  The
tests that need to be carried out during scientific commissioning to
confirm that these requirements are met are
outlined.  The continuing 
tests that can be done on the data to confirm that these
requirements are met are also described (this is an aspect of quality
assurance).  The emphasis everywhere is on requirements that can be
confirmed with well-defined tests with relatively small quantities of
data; without this emphasis, it will be impossible to carry out the
commissioning in a finite amount of time.
<P>
There already exist a number of documents, mostly on the Web, laying
down requirements for various aspects of the survey.  The present
document is largely based on the requirements that have been laid down
previously.  There is a 
<a href=http://www.astro.princeton.edu:81/requirements/README.html>web
page</a>,
which 
includes links to these various previous documents (as well as the
present document).  Every attempt has been made not to contradict
previously adopted requirements.
<P>
In particular, there already exists a 
<a href=
http://www-sdss.fnal.gov/dss/doc/protected/combined.req.html>comprehensive requirements
document</a> for SDSS 
software.
<P>
In addition, there exists a number of documents which have been written
about the test year itself; they can be found from the 
<a href= 
http://www.astro.princeton.edu:81/test/index.html>test year page</a>.  In particular,
see the latest version of the 
<a href=
http://www.astro.princeton.edu:81/test/test_1998.ps>test
year plan</a> (although this
document needs work).  This document
has much overlapping content with the present document, but sorts things
in a somewhat orthogonal way.
<P>
After summarizing the parameters of the survey, this document
systematically goes through each of the major areas of quantitative
requirements.  For each, it outlines the following:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The quantitative requirements themselves.  For most of the
sections below, there are several distinct numbered requirements. 
<DT>2.
<DD>The scientific justification for the requirement.
<DT>3.
<DD>The consequences of not meeting the requirement; that is, what
our fallback position should be if we find we are not meeting it, or
what scientific goals we would not be able to reach. 
<DT>4.
<DD>The tests we must do during the scientific commissioning to
convince ourselves that we are meeting the requirement, including both
the data that need to be obtained, and the analyses to be done with
these data.  This is really the incorporation of the test year plans
into the present document.
<DT>5.
<DD>Who has been given the authority to carry out these tests, and
who has been given authority to sign off on them.  Generically, this
authority is given to the Science Commissioning Committee (SCC), which
reports directly to the Project Scientist, the Director for Program
Management, and the Project Director.  We have indicated individuals
throughout who have these responsibilities at the time that this was
written; this perhaps should be replaced with their titles, so that
the document stays valid if individual's jobs change. 
<DT>6.
<DD>The timescale within which these tasks will be done. 
<DT>7.
<DD>The resources required to carry out these tasks. 
<DT>8.
<DD>Quality Assurance; how we can confirm that these requirements
continue to be met during routine operations.  Data that don't do so
will be declared not to be of survey quality. 
<DT>9.
<DD>Enhanced goals, as appropriate.
<DT>10.
<DD>Further test year tasks.  For any given area, it is likely that
there will be test year tasks 
that cannot be explicitly expressed in terms of quantitative
requirements.  This may include pieces of software that can only be
written with real data in hand, or scientific analyses needed by the
pipeline to set relevant parameters.  Then would follow a
breakdown, as above, of what data are needed, what analysis is needed,
who is responsible, what the timescale is, and how we know when we're
done. 
<DT>11.
<DD>What's missing; a to-do list for the requirements document itself.
<DT>12.
<DD>Eventually, this document could be augmented with reports of
progress on each of the tests being carried out, and indications of
when we have confirmed that a given requirement is met. 
</DL>
<P>
Note that not every one of the above items is included for every
requirement.
<P>
In its present form, this document is not complete; I've indicated in
various sections where further work needs to be done.  Many of the
individual sections have been written in collaboration with various
individuals in the SDSS; their names are indicated.

2 Science Goals of the Survey</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="sec:parameters">&#160;</A>  The basic science goals of the SDSS are outlined in the
<a href=
http://astro.princeton.edu:81/sdss-general/msg.611.html>SDSS Principles of Operation (PoO)</a>.  They are as
follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>To perform a CCD imaging survey of roughly <IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

<DT>2.
<DD>To perform a CCD imaging survey in the equatorial stripe in the
Southern Galactic hemisphere in 5 bands, roughly 200 square degrees,
to roughly two magnitudes fainter.
<DT>3.
<DD>To obtain high quality spectra and thus redshifts for a
set of 10<SUP>6</SUP> galaxies
and 10<SUP>5</SUP> quasars carefully chosen from the imaging data. 
<DT>4.
<DD>To provide the data in a form to enable state-of-the-art studies of the
large-scale distribution of galaxies and quasars, the
luminosity function of quasars for 0 &lt; <I>z</I> &lt; 5, and the properties and evolution of
galaxies, and to identify and study galaxy clusters.
<DT>5.
<DD>To finish the survey in a span of roughly 5 years. 
</DL>
<P>
Although there are myriad other scientific products which the SDSS
will produce, they are either secondary to the above (e.g., Galactic
structure studies) or are necessary intermediate steps for carrying
out the above (e.g., the reddening map); they are described
below, where appropriate.
<P>
More details, and specifications of the hardware, may be found in the
Appendix.

3 Image Quality and Throughput</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="sec:depth">&#160;</A>
<B>This section was written together with Jim Gunn. </B>
<P>
The depth of the imaging scans is determined by the aperture of
the telescope, the scan rate, the size of the CCD's, the transmission
of the atmosphere, the sky brightness, the reflectivity
of all relevant optics, the quantum efficiency and 
noise properties of the CCD detectors, the 
seeing and image quality, and the efficacy of the
reduction software.  The Black Book estimates the effect of all these
quantities, and finds that the 5
<IMG WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\sigma$"> detection limit for a point source in 1'' seeing should be
<I>u</I>' = 22.3, <I>g</I>' = 23.3, <I>r</I>' = 23.1, <I>i</I>' = 22.3, and <I>z</I>' = 20.8.  See
&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:camera-param">A.4</A> for a brief summary of the design parameters
of the imaging camera.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
3.1 Quantitative Requirements</A>
</H2>
<P>
We put requirements only on the parts of the system that we have control
over with the as-built telescope and instrument.  These requirements are
drawn from the requirement documents for the telescope and for the
camera; see the Appendix.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><B>Image Quality on the Imaging Chips</B>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD><I>The telescope in scanning mode off the equator
should return images with better than 1.1'' Full-Width-Half-Maximum
(FWHM) in 0.8'' FWHM free-air seeing.</I>  The design with perfect optics
and 0.8'' free-air seeing returns images over the field with FWHMs
between 0.83'' and 1.04'', 
with images over 1'' only at the extreme edges of the field in <I>u</I>'
and <I>z</I>'.  With optical surface quality corresponding to 0.3'' RMS
image errors, we should easily be able to meet the 1.1'' requirement,
and to better it over most of the field.  
<DT>(b)
<DD><I>The variation in the FWHM of the PSF over the CCD imaging array
should be less than 30% in 0.8'' free-air seeing, and the variation
over a single chip should be less than 15%.</I>  The optical design yields a maximum
variation of FWHM over a given detector of 12% with 0.8'' free-air
seeing, in the edge <I>z</I>' chip, which also has the worst images.  It
also yields a  variation of the FWHM across the array of 25%. 
<DT>(c)
<DD><I>During routine operations, the ellipticity of the PSF
should be less than 12% on all chips.</I>
The design yields a maximum ellipticity when the array is in perfect
focus of 7%, though in the edge fields this is very highly
focus-dependent, and rises in some cases to 14% with the focus off by
only 100 microns (18 microns on the secondary).  <B>Might this be
affected by differential chromatic refraction in the <I>u</I>' and <I>g</I>'
chips at high airmass?</B> 
<DT>(d)
<DD><I>After correction for the power-law scattering wings, the
energy circle enclosing 90% of the received energy should have a
radius less than 2.5 arcseconds.</I> 
When the design images are convolved with a double-Gaussian fit to a
0.8'' Kolmogorov seeing profile, the 
circle enclosing 50% of the energy is in all cases within a few
hundredths of an arcsecond (4%) of the FWHM. The 90% encircled energy 
circle is in all cases between 2.0 and 2.2 arcseconds. In the real images,
this diameter is strongly influenced by the power-law scattering wings,
which typically contain between 5% and 10% of the energy, roughly an
order of magnitude more than is predicted by diffraction. The
scattering wings can be subtracted in software, and we require that the 90%
circle be smaller than 2.5 arcseconds once this is done.
</DL>
<DT>2.
<DD><B>CCD read-noise</B>: <I>The read-noise of the photometric chips
should be below 10 <I>e<SUP>-</SUP></I> (<I>u</I>') and 20 <I>e<SUP>-</SUP></I> (<I>g</I>'<I>r</I>'<I>i</I>'<I>z</I>'). </I>
<DT>3.
<DD><B>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</B>:  <I>The system should
reach signal-to-noise 50 for point sources in 1'' seeing at
magnitudes no brighter than  
18.9, 20.5, 20.2, 19.6, and 18.1 in the five bands, and reach the
detection signal-to-noise limit of 5 at 21.9, 23.2, 22.8, 22.2, and
20.7, both under photometric conditions at airmass 1.4 and with
free-air seeing of 0.8 arcsecond.</I> These brightness levels are
uniformly 0.2 magnitude brighter than expected theoretically.  Note
that this puts an (indirect) requirement on sky brightness. 
<DT>4.
<DD><B>Throughput and Quantum Efficiency</B>:  <I>A 20.0 magnitude
star scanned at sidereal rate with the photometric chips at an airmass
of 1.4 under photometric conditions should give
more than 1300, 9000, 9000, 6500, and 1500 <I>e<SUP>-</SUP></I>, 
for the five filters, respectively.</I> These values are 75% of those
expected theoretically with the typical measured QE of the CCDs.  This
may be thought of as a necessary condition to meet the previous
requirement.
<P><DT>5.
<DD><I>Further requirements COULD be written down on ghosting,
bad columns, scattered light, CTE, full well, and so on.</I>
One could write down what is expected here, but there is little that
could be done if requirements are not met.  One expects appreciable
ghosts <I>a priori</I> only in <I>u</I>' and <I>z</I>'; one sees appreciable
ghosts only in <I>u</I>'.
<P><DT>6.
<DD><I>J. Gunn will write requirements on the performance of
the astrometric chips.</I>
<P><DT>7.
<DD><B>Seeing:</B> The worst images over the photometric array for
acceptable imaging data should have a FWHM no worse than 1.2''.
<P><DT>8.
<DD><B>Completeness of the Imaging Coverage:</B> No more than 3% of
frames, averaged over 1/2 hour of scanning, may be rejected for
non-astronomical reasons (bad seeing, airplane trails, focus problems,
etc.) before the scan in question is marked for reobservation. 
</DL><H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
3.2 Scientific Justification</A>
</H2>
Obtaining deep CCD imaging of the surveyed area is one of the basic
scientific goals of the SDSS.  This requires high throughput and good
image quality. This drives the number of objects
detected, the efficiency of star-galaxy separation at all magnitudes,
the signal-to-noise ratio of the images of spectroscopic targets, and
so on.   Good seeing clearly pushes all these requirements in the same
direction.
<P>
The median free-air seeing at the site is believed to be 0.8''; with
the above requirements, one can image on roughly 1/2 of the dark
photometric nights.  ``Photometric nights'' are defined in the
following section.
<P>
Roughly 3% of the sky will be masked due to bright stars; the
completeness of the imaging coverage allows an equal amount of sky
missed for non-astronomical reasons.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
3.3 Consequences of Not Meeting Requirements</A>
</H2>
Star-galaxy separation, measures of image shape, and the depth of
the data will all be strongly affected.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The image quality is measured for each chip by the on-line Data
Acquisition system.

the free-air seeing directly, so as to test the image quality
requirements. 
<DT>5.
<DD>We can determine the real signal-to-noise ratio at a given flux
level from multiple observations of a given region of sky.

and imaging camera, so Gunn is responsible for tuning
the hardware to meet these requirements.

3.9 What's Missing</A>
</H2>
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>We need requirements on the accuracy and efficiency of the outputs of the
photometric pipeline (and the errors given for each quantity),
especially quantities used in target selection, such as Petrosian
magnitudes.   See &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:target">6</A> and the software requirements
document for some of this.

<DD>We need a requirement on the completeness of the photometric
sample as a function of magnitude (separately for stars and
galaxies).
<P></DL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
4 Photometric Uniformity and Accuracy</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="sec:uniform">&#160;</A><B>This section has been written by Steve Kent and Michael Strauss.</B>
<P>
The photometric calibration of the SDSS data is accomplished by
obtaining accurate photometry of stars in numerous ``secondary
patches'' with the Photometric Telescope, which are subsequently
scanned by the 2.5m.  The full calibration process is a multi-step
procedure, and the allowable errors from each step are detailed below.
The error budget here is quite tight, and it is realized that not all
these items will be realizable at the <EM>start</EM> of the survey, and
as we learn more, the calibrations may be tightened.  For example,
after several years, one can use the multiple
observations of the primary standards to improve the definition of the
photometric system, and thus improve the photometric accuracy
further.  This is called out explicitly in what follows.
<P>
All errors given are rms unless otherwise indicated.
<P><H2><A NAME="SECTION00051000000000000000">
4.1 Quantitative Requirements</A>
</H2>
<P>
The systematic rms errors in calibrating the 2.5m data to the SDSS
photometric system <EM>after two years of routine operation</EM> should be
<P><UL>
<LI> Magnitudes: &lt; 0.02 mag rms over the sky in <I>r</I>' band.
<LI> Colors: &lt; 0.02 mag rms in (<I>g</I>'-<I>r</I>'), (<I>r</I>'-<I>i</I>'), and
&lt; 0.03 mag in  (<I>u</I>'-<I>g</I>'), (<I>i</I>'-<I>z</I>'), for objects with colors bluer than those of
an M0 dwarf (i.e., <I>u</I>'-<I>g</I>' = 2.7; <I>g</I>'-<I>r</I>' = 1.2; <I>r</I>'-<I>i</I>' = 0.6; <I>i</I>' - <I>z</I>'
= 0.4, from Lenz et al.&nbsp;(1998), ApJS, 119, 121).
</UL>
<P>
Magnitudes and colors are computed for any random sample of objects bright enough
that photon shot noise is negligible, over the whole
sky.  At the beginning of the survey, these numbers should be 0.03 mag
in magnitudes and <I>g</I>'-<I>r</I>', <I>r</I>'-<I>i</I>', and 0.04 mag in <I>u</I>'-<I>g</I>', <I>i</I>'-<I>z</I>'.
<P>
Note: the values of the errors in magnitudes and colors are the same;
this allows for the fact that often there are correlated
errors in the raw magnitudes which partially cancel when computing colors.
<P>
The 2% (or 0.02 mag) allowed error in the <I>r</I>' magnitude and colors as defined above
has 11 contributions; the error from each contribution is arbitrarily
taken to be <IMG WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$2\%/\sqrt{11} = 0.6\%$">, although ultimately it is the
combination of all ten that must be constrained.  For a few of these
contributions, we use a smaller error, where it is justified.  We list the error
budget here; the final two items are end-to-end tests.

<DD>Basis: We use 10 stars to define 3 constants (<I>a</I>, <I>b</I>, <I>k</I>)

   <DT>(b)
<DD>Basis:  The primary standard stars are observed with short
	integrations at high count rate, while

<DT>(a)
<DD>Requirement: <I>The uncertainty of the best-fit
solution to the primary star magnitudes determined over a 1.5 hour
interval should be less than 0.6% in all 
bands, for airmasses between 1 and 1.75, not including the uncertainty
in the primary star magnitudes themselves.  That is, the scatter of
the standard stars around the best-fit solution, divided by the square
root of the number
of degrees of freedom, should be less than 0.6%, after correcting for
the known uncertainty of the primary star magnitudes.</I>
<DT>(b)
<DD>Basis: This test accounts for errors from uncorrected variations
	in extinction during a night and any other uncalibrated
	effects.  Airmass 1.75 is the highest airmass at which survey
	scans will be taken. Note that it does <EM>not</EM> include the effects of
	uncertainties in the standard star magnitudes themselves; that

   <DT>(c)
<DD>How to test:
	<DL COMPACT>
<DT>i.
<DD>Carry out observations of the primary standards only within

<DD>Calibration of PT patches.
   <DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>Requirement: <I>The zeropoint for photometry of faint PT stars anywhere
in a secondary patch shall have an
	rms error no worse than 0.6% relative to the mean zero-point for
	bright stars in the patch.</I>   This error includes sky subtraction
	and any
	algorithmic systematic errors, but excludes flatfielding errors and
	photon statistics.  It is presumed that these contributions to
	this error are systematic and
	thus do not cancel out for many stars in a patch. Here
   <DT>(b)
<DD>Basis: Sky subtraction and aperture corrections are important
potential sources of error for faint stars.  The dividing line between
bright and faint assumed here is a tunable parameter in MTpipe; we use
this definition consistently throughout this section.  But we might
consider ``bright'' to refer to stars bright enough that photon
statistics in their photometry is negligible, while ``faint'' are the
majority of objects at relatively low signal-to-noise value, which
will be used for the calibration of the secondary patches.

   <DT>(b)
<DD>Basis:  The photometric calibration is affected by scattered light

4.2 Scientific Justification</A>
</H2>
The requirements above are driven by the science goals outlined here.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Science of large scale structure from the galaxy and quasar
redshift surveys shall not 
be significantly affected by photometric errors (including the effects
of Galactic extinction).  Errors in
photometric zero point cause errors in galaxy counts that
mimic large scale structure in any apparent magnitude limited sample.
On angular scales comparable to that of the whole survey, an error
budget to the galaxy number counts in the 
spectroscopic survey is roughly as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>2% True large-scale structure
<DT>(b)
<DD>&lt;4% Uncorrected Galactic extinction
<DT>(c)
<DD>1% Uncorrected errors in completeness corrections
<DT>(d)
<DD>2% Systematic photometric error.
</DL>
<DT>2.
<DD>For quasar target selection:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>Photometric errors shall not contribute appreciably to the
number of false negatives. 
Those quasars which have colors that put them close to the
stellar locus will not be observed spectroscopically.
Systematic errors in photometry cause the region in color-color space 
that is omitted to wander relative to the locus of all quasars, making
the selection of quasar targets non-uniform.
It is required that the variation in incompleteness and types of
quasars that are selected be small.  The error is TBD.
<P><DT>(b)
<DD>Photometric errors shall not contribute appreciably to the
number of false positives.
<P>
Systematic errors in photometry cause the measured stellar locus
to wander relative to the fixed selection criteria, increasing the
number of stars falsely identified as quasars.  Similarly, statistical
errors in photometry cause the stellar locus to broaden, scattering stars
into the region of color-color space occupied by quasars. This is
particularly important at <IMG WIDTH="57" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img8.gif"
 ALT="$z \approx 2.8$">, where the quasar locus
passes particularly close to that of stars.
<P>
The intrinsic rms width of the stellar locus in color space is 0.04
mag at its fattest.  We wish that this increase by no more than 10%
to keep the quasar false positives to a minimum.  If we presume
Gaussian errors, then the maximum 
tolerable increase in observational error (per color projected
perpendicular to the stellar locus) is <IMG WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img9.gif"
 ALT="$\sqrt{1.1^2-1}\times 0.04 =
0.018$"> mag.  This then can be taken as the acceptable error in <I>g</I>'-<I>r</I>'
and <I>r</I>'-<I>i</I>'.  The <I>u</I>'-<I>g</I>' error can be twice as large.
<P>
Stars redder than M0 have a larger intrinsic cosmic scatter in their
colors than do bluer stars; also, their spectra are complex and cause
the linear relationships used in the color terms in the photometric calibrations 
to break down.  Loosening the requirements on photometric accuracy for
these red objects is
not likely to compromise science.

5 Astrometric Requirements</A>

<A NAME="sec:astrom">&#160;</A>
Requirements on astrometry fall into two categories: requirements on
absolute astrometry in a given band (we refer here to <I>r</I>'), and
requirements on the relative astrometry between bands.  We treat the
two separately here.  This section of the document was prepared by
Jeff Pier, 
based in part on the 
<a href=

requirements.   For

<P>
Each requirement in this section is expressed as an rms figure per
coordinate in units of milli-arcseconds (hereinafter mas) along a great
circle.

5.1 Requirements on Absolute Astrometry</A>
</H2>
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00061100000000000000">
5.1.1 Quantitative Requirements</A>
</H3>
 The requirements in this subsection apply to the positions determined
in <I>r</I>' for point-source objects brighter than <I>r</I>' = 19 with spectral
type between O5 and M0. The determination of
positions for very blue, very red, or emission-line objects may, and
certainly occasionally will, fail to meet the requirements, due to
differential chromatic refraction.
<P>
It is expected that the requirements herein will be satisfied for each
``acceptable imaging run.'' Here an acceptable imaging run is a scan of
length no less than 20 minutes (exclusive of ``ramp-up'' frames),
airmass <IMG WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$\le 2.0$">,seeing <IMG WIDTH="43" HEIGHT="26" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

no worse than 3 arcsec rms (2-D on the sky) and relative telescope
tracking error no worse than 50 mas (1-D on the sky) on time scales
of 1-10 minutes.

There are three different levels of requirement for absolute astrometry:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The ``Drop-Dead'' requirement - if the astrometry does not meet
this, the run will be deemed unacceptable since core survey science
would be jeopardized:
<B>The absolute astrometry on the sky should be no worse than

<P><DT>2.
<DD>The ``Science Goals'' requirement - the astrometry should routinely
meet this requirement to enable non-core science:
<P><B>The absolute astrometry on the sky should be no worse than

<P><DT>3.
<DD>The ``Enhanced Goal'' requirement - if all goes well (<I>i.e.</I>,
the telescope tracks well, the atmosphere (seeing, anomalous refraction)
are favorable, the catalog density is at or above 10 stars/deg<SUP>2</SUP>) the
astrometry should be limited by the atmosphere:
<P><B>Reasonable effort should be expended to attain absolute astrometry
on the sky of 60 mas.</B>
(<I>N.B.</I> - the number that appears here is really no more than an
educated guess about the properties of the atmosphere.)
</DL><H3><A NAME="SECTION00061200000000000000">
5.1.2 Scientific Justification</A>
</H3>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The requirement of 180 mas ensures that astrometric errors do not
contribute significantly to loss of spectroscopic fiber throughput (see
the ``Black Book,'' Section 10.1, as well as the
<a href=http://www.astro.princeton.edu:81/requirements/fiber_spec.ps>requirements on drilling
accuracy</a>).
<DT>2.
<DD>Currently (and soon to be) available all-sky/wide-area astrometric
catalogs can be used with SDSS data to determine proper motions.  The
100 mas
requirement ensures that the accuracy of the proper motion determinations
will be limited by the other catalogs, not by SDSS.
Additionally, SDSS data will be used to identify optical counterparts of
objects detected in other spectral regions. Again, this requirement
will ensure that SDSS positions are not the limiting factor in making
the identifications.
<DT>3.
<DD>There is no specific scientific justification for the enhanced goal.
Rather it is felt that the survey astrometry should be ``as good as it
can be.''  The astrometric performance can be no better than limits imposed by
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>the effects of the atmosphere (``seeing'' and ``anomalous refraction'');
<DT>(b)
<DD>discontinuous telescope motions due, for example, to glitches in 
tracking or in mirror motion;
<DT>(c)
<DD>the accuracy and density of available astrometric reference frames
(catalogs).
</DL>
In nearly ideal conditions, the astrometric accuracy should approach such
limits which are thought (but by no means proven) to be, when added in
quadrature, on the order of 60 mas.
</DL><H3><A NAME="SECTION00061300000000000000">
5.1.3 Consequences of Not Meeting Requirements</A>
</H3>
If the ``Drop-Dead'' requirement is not met it will seriously impact
the core science of the Survey; the signal-to-noise ratio of the
spectra will be degraded. If the ``Science Goals'' requirement is not
met, the SDSS astrometry will dominate the error budget in future proper
motion studies. 
<H3><A NAME="SECTION00061400000000000000">
5.1.4 How do we determine if these requirements are met?</A>
</H3>
The ideal, direct way to determine astrometric performance is simply to
compare star positions determined with SDSS with those determined
externally.  Since positions of objects in the <I>r</I>' photometric bandpass
are required, it is necessary to compare positions of stars which
are fainter than 14th magnitude (and indeed down to
19th to fully satisfy the requirement).  The only wide-area astrometric
catalogs available for such comparisons with accuracies reliably better
than our requirement of 180 mas are the catalogs constructed from the
POSS-II plates (catalogs of the northern sky are being generated by the
USNO's PMM machine, STScI's digital sky survey and Minnesota's Automated
Plate Scanner).  These catalogs are expected to be accurate to 
about 150 mas at the epoch at which they were taken.
<P>
The equatorial
astrometric zones established by USNO for SDSS can be used to judge
performance to higher accuracy.  These 
zones have typical astrometric accuracies of 70 mas at the faint
end (<IMG WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img12.gif"
 ALT="$r' \sim 17 $">).  These fields are limited to the equator and
do not allow for a full exploration of telescope tracking parameter
space, and offer only a limited range for exploring atmospheric
variations across the sky.  They do represent, however, our best
external check on astrometric performance.
<P>
For the future, the USNO is conducting a ``red lens survey''
which will reach to about 16th magnitude with an accuracy approaching
50 mas.  The southern red lens survey is underway now and should finish
in the year 2000, after which the telescope/detector will be moved to
the northern hemisphere.  Once operational, it  will require an additional
two years to complete the observations.  While the catalog produced
from this survey may be helpful in eventually producing an astrometric
catalog over the SDSS survey area, it will not be available to help
determine the SDSS performance in the first few years of the survey.
<P>
But, for now, the alternative is to use a boot-strap approach:
matching detections on the astrometric chips with catalog positions of
astrometric reference stars, then transferring the solution, using bridge 
stars of intermediate magnitudes, to the <I>r</I>' bandpass.
(This is, in fact, how the astrometry solution is done in the first
place.)  This method is somewhat circular but is really the
only choice.
<P>
It is difficult to perform external checks to accuracies better than
150 mas or so since SDSS is in the happy position of being unique as
an astrometrically accurate, wide-area, faint-limit survey.
<P>
Repeated scans of the same patch of sky will allow for a very useful
consistency/internal check, but such experiments will not be able to
rule out all systematic effects. The number of secondary overlap stars can
be enlarged by scanning a strip once, then scanning again after shifting
the bore-sight by half a chip-width (instead of the normal <IMG WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img13.gif"
 ALT="$\sim$">chip-width) for consistency checking.  Another possibility is to scan
over a given region in different directions.  For example, we could
carry out a few scans in a direction perpendicular to the main scans,
which should have quite different systematics.

Deducing the relative contributions to astrometric error from (1) the
atmosphere, (2) telescope, (3) camera, and (4) astrom pipeline+catalogs is
a non-trivial matter.  Here are a few suggestions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Run simulated data through the pipeline:  if the simulations are
correct(!!), one should be able to gauge the pipeline performance, since
one knows the input parameters, including complicating factors arising
from hardware and/or the atmosphere put into the simulations.  <I>This
kind of testing has been carried out in the past, and with correct
inputs from the simulation, the pipeline returns errors which

<DD>Carry out multiple observations of a given region of sky (both
with the telescope parked on the equator, and scanning in great
circles) and compare the astrometric results.  Any differences cannot
be due to problems in the input catalogs. 
<DT>3.
<DD>On several windless nights with excellent seeing, park the
telescope on the equator and scan: the resulting errors 
should be due to the atmosphere or catalog systematics or pipeline problems.
The difficulty here is ascertaining that <EM>nothing is moving</EM> (i.e. no
movements of telescope optics, telescope axes, wind baffle, camera, no

The requirements of this subsection are described

requirement.  Relative astrometry is measured not on an

perhaps somewhat longer (to be determined).

<DT>1.
<DD>Relative astrometry of 180 mas is adequate for merging of
objects, and is acceptable for deblending. 
<DT>2.
<DD>Relative astrometry of 100 mas is ideal for deblending, and also
minimizes systematic errors in aperture photometry colors.

5.1.7 Further Test Year Tasks</A>
</H3>
We need to determine whether a single frame is the
optimal timescale to measure the mean astrometric offset between
frames, given the nature of the 
atmosphere.  If it is longer, the calculation cannot be done within
frames, and it will have to be rethought.  However, it is probably
true that in this case, we can go ahead with the current code within
the astrometric pipeline for determining the relative offsets between
colors; this probably meets the drop-dead requirement already.

6 Target Selection</A>
</H1>
<A NAME="sec:target">&#160;</A><B>This section has been written by David Weinberg and Michael Strauss.</B>
<P>
The ``target selection requirements'' in effect impose requirements
on the data reduction pipelines (photo in particular), the target
selection pipeline, and the target selection algorithms, given the
properties of data returned by the telescope/camera/spectrographs
under survey imaging conditions.  The primary ``adjustables'' are
the algorithms themselves and the definitions of acceptable
observing conditions for survey imaging and spectroscopy.
<P>
The primary requirement is that spectroscopic target selection be
uniform enough that uncertainties in the selection function will
not be the limiting factor in studies of galaxy clustering,
quasar clustering, or distribution functions (such as the luminosity
function) of the galaxy and quasar populations.  However, a
requirement worded in this form is essentially impossible to
check prior to completing and analyzing the SDSS.  We therefore
list quantitative, testable requirements below with the hope
that meeting these requirements will also mean meeting this
underlying requirement.  A secondary desideratum for the target
selection algorithms is that they select a broad range of galaxy
and quasar types. In other words, the main galaxy and quasar
samples should be as ``complete'' as possible to a given apparent
magnitude limit, to the extent that this completeness can be
accomplished without compromising the uniformity of the samples
or being too inefficient.
<P>
The sample selection listed below will involve ``fuzzy'' boundaries.
For example, close to the nominal photometric limit of the galaxy or
quasar sample, the probability that an object is chosen is not a
step-function of magnitude, but rather a slowly varying function.
This gives target selection some robustness to errors in the
photometry, and allows exploration of the sample selection near the
sample boundaries.
<P>
The three main science samples are:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>A selection of galaxies to a magnitude limit in <IMG WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img15.gif"
 ALT="$r^\prime$">, with
an additional cut on surface brightness to ensure high spectroscopic
completeness.  The current plan is to use Petrosian magnitudes and half-light
surface brightness as the selection parameters, with auxiliary
selection with fiber magnitudes.
<DT>2.
<DD>An auxiliary selection of galaxies determined by photometric
redshifts to be particularly luminous and red, going approximately 1.5 magnitudes
fainter in <I>r</I>' than the main galaxy sample. 
<DT>3.
<DD>A selection of quasars based on their optical colors, 
apparent magnitudes, and 20 cm radio fluxes (from the FIRST survey).  For the
purposes of this discussion, a
quasar is defined as any extragalactic object whose optical light is
dominated by an unresolved core with at least one of the following
properties: 
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>A non-stellar continuum;
<DT>(b)
<DD>Strong, broad (FWHM&gt;500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) emission lines; or
<DT>(c)
<DD>Strong high-ionization emission lines. 
</DL>
The default plan for quasar target selection divides the northern
survey area into two parts, according 
to the predicted star density from the Bahcall-Soneira models.  In the
central, low-density region (the ``cap''), the aim 
will be the highest possible uniformity and the most complete possible
quasar catalog, to an apparent magnitude limit (probably in the <I>i</I>' band),
with a reasonable efficiency (65% has been the fiducial).  In the
higher stellar density skirt, we presume that the stellar
contamination will be much higher (although it is possible that this
is not the case; this remains to be seen).  In this case, the goal is
to get the relatively rare, 
but scientifically valuable brighter quasars because they can be
followed up in high-resolution studies, and because they allow us to
explore the high-luminosity end of the luminosity function.  This will be done 
by accepting a lower efficiency and less complete sample, but overall
a smaller density of targets than in the cap. 
High-redshift (<I>z</I> &gt; 5) quasars are both very rare and are
more scientifically valuable than lower-redshift quasars, and thus a much lower efficiency will be
acceptable.  
</DL>
<P>
The current descriptions of these algorithms are given in
<a href=
 http://astro.princeton.edu:81/documents/galaxy_selection.ps>``Galaxy and Cluster Selection Algorithm for
SDSS''</a>, 
and 
<a href=
 http://astro.princeton.edu:81/sdss-qsos/msg.57.html>``Quasar Target
Selection Algorithm''</a>; 
many further explications and analyses can be found via the
galaxy and quasar working group mailing lists.  Algorithms should not
be constrained by coding convenience; it is fair to say that the
target selection algorithms are as important as those in upstream
pipelines.
<P>
For brevity, we will refer to the objects in the main galaxy sample
as ``galaxies'' and to those in the auxiliary sample as ``BRGs''
(for bright red galaxies).
Note that calibration targets (e.g., spectrophotometric standards)
are not explicitly mentioned here, nor are stellar and
serendipitous science targets; these do not belong in the high-level
requirements document.   Also not described here are requirements on
interactions between targeted objects.  See Steve Kent's 
<a href=http://www-sdss.fnal.gov/dss/doc/protected/combined.req.html>software
requirements
document</a>
for these and other details.
<P>
The targets selected for the Southern strip survey will be a superset
of those selected by these algorithms -- e.g., with more generous
magnitude limits, surface brightness cuts, color cuts, and morphology
cuts.
<P>
Once targets are selected based on the pipeline outputs in the operational
database, they are assigned to spectroscopic tiles.  Some fraction of the
tiled targets will be lost because they lie within 55&quot; of another target.

6.2 Scientific Justification</A>
</H2>
<P>
As mentioned in the introduction to this section, the main scientific
justification underlying all of these requirements is that our
measurements of the clustering and distribution functions
of the galaxy and quasar populations should not be limited by
uncertainties in the selection function.  
A second general justification, especially relevant for quasars
and to some extent BRGs, is to identify objects for follow-up studies.
For example, we would like to identify a high fraction of the
bright quasars (<I>i</I>'&lt;18) as targets for follow-up high-resolution spectroscopy.
Justifications for the specific quantitative requirements are given
below, labeled according to the requirement numbers above.
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>This surface density gives 10<SUP>6</SUP> galaxies over 10<SUP>4</SUP>
square degrees.  The sky coverage and error reflect our
understanding of the fluctuations due to large-scale structure. 
<DT>2.
<DD>The 95% threshold ensures that we will get close to our
desired goal of 10<SUP>6</SUP> galaxies, with small contribution from stars
selected incorrectly as galaxies.  From the point of view of sample
uniformity, the essential requirement is that the targets that do not
yield redshifts do so for reasons that are independent of the spectroscopic
observing conditions (e.g., they have no useful spectroscopic features within
our bandpass), so that the selection function is simply multiplied
by a constant redshift incompleteness factor.  We clearly need to
characterize the variation of the fraction of objects for which we are
unable to measure redshifts, as this variation will leave an imprint
on large-scale structure measures. 
<DT>3.
<DD>This is the main requirement ensuring uniformity of the galaxy
sample for large scale structure and galaxy population studies.
In order to determine the selection function, we need to be able to compute
for each sample galaxy the maximum distance to which it would be
included in the sample (or, more generally, the probability of
inclusion as a function of distance).  This is only possible if 
the galaxies that should be included are included and the galaxies that 
should be excluded are excluded.  Note that this wording allows fuzzy
selection boundaries to be implemented.  Note also that this and the
following two requirements ask for consistency in the star-galaxy
separation to the spectroscopic limit. 
<DT>4.
<DD>This is a secondary requirement aimed at ensuring uniformity
of the galaxy sample, again allowing fuzzy boundaries.  It implies
that the properties of the selected  
galaxies do not depend significantly on the imaging conditions.  This
then puts important requirements on the robustness of the galaxy
photometry, and the star-galaxy separation.  These may well be the
principal determination of the maximum acceptable seeing,
transparency, and sky brightness for the survey. 
<DT>5.
<DD>This is a third requirement aimed at ensuring uniformity of
the galaxy sample, concentrating on effects that could produce fluctuations
in the efficiency of target selection on angular scales comparable to
that of the survey itself.  Potential effects of this sort include
influence of bright stars on sky subtraction, errors in the a priori
extinction map or the photometric calibration, or hardware effects
that depend on the direction in which the telescope is pointing.
The requirement is fairly weak as worded, due to the substantial
contribution from large-scale structure on these scales. 
<DT>6-8.
<DD>The requirements and justifications are analogous to those
of [2-4] for the main galaxy sample.  The numbers are looser because
the questions we aim to address with the BRG sample are less detailed,
and because it seems unrealistic to think that we can obtain the same
level of spectroscopic completeness for the BRG sample as for the
main galaxy sample (if we can, we are perhaps being too conservative
in our apparent magnitude limit).   
<DT>9.
<DD>With the default numbers above, we would get
80,000 quasars in the 5,000 square degree cap if the selection efficiency
in this region is 80%, and 20,000 quasars in the 5,000 square degree
skirt if the selection efficiency in this region is 50%; however, the
minimum efficiency numbers listed in [10] are below this.
<DT>10.
<DD>The combination of this with requirement [9]
determines the number of quasars that will actually be discovered
by the SDSS.  
<DT>11.
<DD>We would like to have as complete a quasar sample as possible
within the limits of practicality, so that studies of the quasar
population are not limited by selection biases.  We would ideally like
to have had an absolute requirement on the
completeness of quasar target selection, but such a requirement would
necessarily be untestable without a spectroscopic survey of <EM>
every</EM> stellar object over a quite large area.  As known quasars have
been selected with a wide range of techniques, this requirement
captures the spirit of the ideal requirement. 
<DT>12.

especially important for clustering measurements.
<DT>13.
<DD>The galaxies that are missed because they are not tiled will
have a complicated spatial pattern that depends on details of tiling
algorithm and the observing strategy.  It will be virtually impossible
to correct measures of large scale structure for this effect because
it will be so poorly understood, so we adopt a conservative limit on
the fraction of galaxies that can be missed.  Of course a much larger
fraction of galaxies (<IMG WIDTH="44" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

minimum fiber spacing, but this is an effect that is easy to understand
and can be compensated for in a straightforward manner.  Note that we
have not written down an equivalent requirement on tiling <EM>
efficiency</EM>; the tiling algorithm gives a one-to-one correspondence
between efficiency and completeness, and the requirement on the
timescale of the survey require that tiling be conducted at high
efficiency.

<DD>This requirement suggests fuzzy boundaries on magnitude
cuts, as described above.   Moreover, as discussed in
&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:uniform">4</A>, the photometric errors are likely to be larger
at the beginning of the survey than in the end; target selection
should take this into account, and allow enough fuzziness that a
complete sample can be defined from the spectroscopic data once
improved photometry is available.

6.4 How do we determine if these requirements are met?</A>
</H2>
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1,9.
<DD>After imaging multiple areas, we tune the selection thresholds
(primarily the magnitude limit) in order to get the desired surface densities.
Note that for quasars this will require imaging at a range of Galactic
positions and appropriate averaging, since the density of candidates
will vary with stellar density even though the density of quasars
should not. <I>We need to determine how many such areas are needed.</I>
<DT>2.
<DD>Using spectroscopic observations, including multiple observations
of several fields over the full range (and presumably beyond the full range)
of acceptable survey spectroscopy conditions.  We would also imagine
loosening the galaxy target selection criteria, especially on surface
brightness, to see to what low surface brightness we might be able to
go.  This would allow us to do large-scale structure studies as a
function of surface brightness.  One could carry out a long series of
15 minute spectroscopic exposures of a sample of galaxies extending
several tenths of a magnitude fainter than the nominal limit, and ask how many needed
to be co-added to meet the redshift completeness requirement at each
magnitude. 
<DT>3.
<DD>This the most important of the requirements, at least from the point
of view of galaxy large scale structure studies, and it is also the toughest
to check because in general we do not know the ``true'' values of galaxy
photometric parameters.  There are two useful methods for assessing
whether this requirement is being met:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>Photometric parameters measured from a 1/4 sidereal, hence deep
imaging scan are taken as ``truth,'' since they are measured at higher
signal-to-noise ratio (although such a test does not check all
systematic effects).   This test requires a deep scan of a significant
area of sky (probably <IMG WIDTH="38" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img19.gif"
 ALT="$\sim 10$"> square degrees, yielding <IMG WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.gif"
 ALT="$\sim 1000$"> galaxy
targets, although the exact value remains to be determined) followed
by one or more scans of the standard depth.   
Alternatively, we can co-add multiple frames (or, much easier, the
atlas images) taken of a given region of sky 
scanned at sidereal rate; this requires that the code to co-add atlas
images must be developed. 
<DT>(b)
<DD>Bright galaxies with well measured target selection parameters
are artificially redshifted and inserted at random locations into the
imaging data.  We then see what fraction of them are recovered as targets
after running through the data reduction and target selection pipelines.
This test will be a lot of work.
</DL>
<DT>4.
<DD>Using repeated photometric scans of the same regions under
varying observing conditions.  
<DT>5.
<DD>By applying the target selection algorithm to scans over
a wide range of positions on the sky.
<DT>6.
<DD>Same as [2].  
<DT>7.
<DD>The 10 square degree survey mentioned in [3(a)] would yield
only 100 BRG's, which may be inadequate to explore the BRG target
selection.  
There are 3 areas to test:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>The surface density limits and scatter propagation may be
tested by observing fields without any color cut and with
	a relaxed luminosity cut.
<DT>(b)
<DD>Photometric measurements (including known problems with Petrosian
	magnitudes e.g, for cD galaxies) may be tested with a 1/4 sidereal
	scan of &nbsp;10 square degrees providing higher signal to noise.
<DT>(c)
<DD>The measurements of luminosity and rest frame color may be
	tested with spectra and spectrophotometry of a large number of
targets.
</DL>
We will probably need imaging and spectroscopy of &nbsp;0.5% of the full
survey to get adequate statistics for the BRGs (500 BRG plus a few hundred
outside the strict BRG limits).
<DT>8.
<DD>Same as [4].
<DT>10.
<DD>By spectroscopic follow-up of quasar targets in fields covering
a range of sky positions (since the efficiency may vary strongly
with stellar density). <I>We need to quantify how many fields are needed.</I>
<DT>11.
<DD>Scan areas where there have been extensive previous quasar
surveys to <I>i</I>' = 19, preferably using multiple methods. 
<DT>12.
<DD>Same as [2] and [6].
<DT>13.
<DD>The fraction of targets untiled should be a tunable parameter
in the tiling algorithm itself.  We just have to ensure that this
requirement is met as the survey proceeds.
<DT>14.
<DD>The fuzziness of target selection cuts are a series of
tunable parameters, which will be set with the worst-case allowable

Commissioning of target selection is the single largest task of the

successful completion of these tasks will largely define

6.7 Quality Assurance</A>
</H2>
<P>
During the commissioning period, we will be able to measure the
standard deviation of the number of galaxy, BRG, and quasar
targets of different types as a function of area, e.g., in
<IMG WIDTH="70" HEIGHT="28" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"

The situation will be trickier for quasar targets than for galaxies/BRGs
because the surface density will change systematically with sky
position (because of the varying number of false positives (stars)
with position), so we will need to develop a model for the mean and 
standard deviation of target numbers as a function of position.
<P>
We will also be able to measure the distribution function of the
fractions of galaxy/BRG, and quasar targets that are spectroscopically
confirmed as the expected kind of object and yield measured redshifts,

and spectroscopic redshifts of BRGs.

 The primary goal of the spectroscopic observations is to determine the

ratio spectra over a wide wavelength range.  The absolute throughput
requirements are needed to produced the required signal-to-noise ratio
for the most challenging objects (galaxies with brightnesses at the
spectroscopic limit).  If the fiber-to-fiber variations are too large,

<P>
The accuracy of the wavelength scale translates directly into the
accuracy of the redshift measurements.  For any reasonable expected
error, this will be negligible for quasar redshifts, but will
significantly impact both galaxy and quasar absorption line redshifts. Flexure in
the wavelength direction produces a degradation in the wavelength scale
and resolution; flexure in the perpendicular direction reduces the
signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum and hence the accuracy of the
redshift. Crosstalk degrades the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra,
and is likely to give biased redshifts.

7.3.2 Scientific Justification</A>

Investigations of small scale/cluster structure with galaxies near the
photometric limit require the stated galaxy redshift accuracy.  To efficiently
analyze the data one needs to be certain that the reliability of the
classifications and the redshifts is high.

7.3.3 Consequences of not meeting requirements</A>
</H3>
<P>
Failure to reach the redshift accuracies for the galaxies will
severely limit the investigation of small scale/cluster structure.
The quasar redshift accuracy limit is driven more by what should be
possible than by scientific goals; the primary goals of the survey can
be met with errors several times larger than the stated limit.  Larger
quasar redshift errors would adversely impact areas such as quasar
absorption lines and gravitational lenses.
<P>
Unless the classification reliability meets the requirements, it will
not be possible to trust the automated classifications and each

Simulated spectra will provide an important test of the redshift
software, but this will not be entirely satisfactory; all we can say
is that if the software cannot meet the requirements on simulated
spectra we can be assured that we won't be able to determine redshifts
in the real data.
<P>
Observational tests of the reliability can be done by observing the
same (or more than one) field several times and examining the distribution
of measured redshifts for each of the objects.

In addition, we could do multiple short exposures of a given field,
and ask how many need to be co-added before the redshift reliability
meets specifications.  This needs to be fleshed out.

<P>
The above operational requirements are put in with the scientific aim
of yielding an rms error in the relative spectrophotometric calibration
averaged in 200&#197; chunks over the entire spectrum no more than
10%.
<P>
The main science driver for SDSS spectrophotometry is the detailed
study of the stellar content of galaxies and its evolution with
environment and redshift.  We also would like to have one of the main
scientific products of the SDSS, the spectra of over one million
objects, be fully calibrated.
<P>
Spectrophotometry for SDSS galaxies would also help in the redshift
determinations of galaxies as it would allow direct fitting, in
wavelength space, of the galaxy data with well-known
spectrophotometric templates.
<P>
The requirement on the brightness of the calibration stars is to
ensure that the PT can obtain a high signal-to-noise detection of
the star, through the intermediate-band spectrophotometric filters,
in a short integration time.  The star cannot be too bright, to
minimize the cross-talk between fibers.  Three stars are needed in
case some turn out to be variable, and may be useful in
non-photometric conditions if the atmospheric transparency varies
appreciably across the field of the telescope.  Finally, note that one
can only do a poor job of synthesizing the spectrophotometry from the
combination of the SDSS broad-band photometry, as one has only three
points (<I>g</I>', <I>r</I>', and <I>i</I>') included in the spectral coverage.

factor.  The timing requirement comes from the principle that the survey 
should be fundamentally limited by 2.5-m telescope operations, as opposed 
to the throughput of any of the other SDSS systems (otherwise, the rate of 
progress of the survey would be potentially limited by too many other 
bottlenecks).

There are a number of requirements which are not discussed in this
section:
<P><DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>A requirement on the maximum allowable size of any contiguous regions not
covered by the imaging at the end of the survey (see the discussion in
&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:depth">3</A>).
<DT>2.
<DD>Requirements on sky brightness, transparency, and seeing beyond
which imaging would not be done.  <I>These could be different for
North and South observing.</I>  Criteria for determining these limits
could include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>(a)
<DD>Depth of photometry; see &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:depth">3</A>.
<DT>(b)

<DT>(d)
<DD>Meeting of target selection requirements; see
&#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:target">6</A>.

These will tie into requirements on photometric depth and uniformity,
and on accuracy of target selection; see those sections for more
detail.  A strawman suggestion for the seeing requirement is no worse
than 1.2'' over the photometric array (not counting the <I>u</I>' chips,
which will be strongly affected by differential chromatic aberration
at large airmass).

<DD>Requirements on sky brightness, transparency, and seeing beyond
which spectroscopy would not be done; see &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:spectro">7</A>.  The principal criterion for
determining these limits will be signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra;
see also &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:target">6</A>.
<P><DT>4.
<DD>A check that the signal-to-noise ratio improves as expected as
the Southern stripe data are co-added. <I>If it doesn't for some
reason, our strategy for Southern Stripe observing will change.  We

adequate spares on the mountain, etc.  See &#167;&nbsp;<A HREF="scireq.html#sec:down">8.5</A>.

<DD>A requirement that we be able to acquire spectroscopic fields
quickly even if the telescope does not meet pointing specifications.
Alan Uomoto has suggested using a 10'' Celestron + CCD strapped to the
telescope for this purpose; see

studies.
