<h1>SDSS DAS User's Guide</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

The DAS webserver will time out for queries taking longer than
20 minutes to process.  In such a case, you may wish to break
down your query into smaller, DAS-digestible queries.
<P>
Here are current (18 March 2003) measurements
of how long it takes to process queries:
<pre>

   # files      time
  requested
  ---------     ----
     100        5 sec
    1000       60 sec
    2000      135 sec
    5000      660 sec
   10000      >20 min (times out)

</pre>
The above timing estimates assumes that the rsync method
of downloading the files was selected; selecting tar.gz,
tar, or zip methods take substantially longer to process
and are therefore limited to queries requesting 10 or
fewer files.  


<h2>Directory Formats</h2>

The location of files on disk at FNAL is described in the <a
href=http://www-sdss.fnal.gov/edoc/dm/flatFiles/DIRS.html>Data Model
Directory Structure</a> document. It is up to you to define the root
directory for data you download to your machine.  The data files you
retrieve from the DAS (either as a .tar, .tar.gz, or .zip file archive
file or as an 
<a href=http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/documentation.html>rsync</a>
command) will be organized into subdirectories under your root
directory, mimicking the directory structure at FNAL.


<h2> The Web Interface </h2>

<a href=http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/DAS>The web interface to the
DR1 DAS </a> is configured for public access to the DR1 data.

<p>
The steps to use this interface are outlined on the interface:
<ol>

<li> <b>Select one or more data products:</b>  <p>Use the buttons to select
what kind of files you want.  If you don't know what the abbreviations
mean, click on the short file description to see the data model
description of the file type.</p>
    <p>For each file type, the table on the right lists which
    parameters you need to specify in your upload file to locate files
    of this type.  So, for example, if you want to retrieve fpC files,
    your upload file must contain <bf>run</bf>, <bf>rerun</bf>,
    <bf>camCol</bf>, <bf>filter</bf>, <bf>field</bf> for each object.</p></li>

<li><a name="fileformat"></a> <b>Create the upload file:</b>

    The upload file you create contains a list of objects.  For each
of the objects, you must specify the necessary parameters as given in
the table, based on the data products you selected in the previous
step.  There are four formats that the DAS understands.  It uses the
file specification (.csv, .tbl, .par, .fit, or .fits) to guess the
file format, so please name your files appropriately.  Here are sample
files for:

	<ul>

	  <li> <a href=imaging.csv>Comma Separated Value
(imaging.csv)</a> for imaging data.  This contains run, rerun, camcol,
field, and filter, so it can be used to get fpC files, for example.  
Note that the first line is a comma separated list of the parameter names.  
This is mandatory.

	  <li> <a href=spectro.csv>Comma Separated Value
(spectro.csv)</a> for spectro data.  This contains plate, mjd, fiberID,
and sprerun, so it could be used to get spSpec files. Note that
	      sprerun is an optional parameter - for the DR1, only
	      spRerun 19 is available and the default.</li>

	  <li> <a href=imaging.tbl>Table File (imaging.tbl) </a> for
imaging data.  This contains field, run, rerun, and camCol, so it can
be used to get tsObj files.  To get fpC or fpBIN files, you would need
	      to add a "filter" column.</li>

	  <li> <a href=spectro.tbl>Table File (spectro.tbl) </a> for
spectro data.  This contains the same information as the spectro.cvs
file above.  Note that the columns are in a different order.  This
does not matter -- as long as the information in the column header
agrees with the information in the data for the column!</li>

	  <li> <a href=imaging.par>ASCII Parameter File (imaging.par)
</a> for imaging data.  This contains run, rerun, camcol, field,
filter.</li>

	  <li> <a href=spectro.par>ASCII Parameter File (spectro.par)
</a> for spectro data.  This contains plate, mjd, and rerun, and can
be used to get spPlate files.</li>

	  <li> <a href=imaging.fit>FITS Binary Table (.fit) </a> for
imaging data.  This contains run, rerun, camcol, field, and filter
information, and can be used to get fpC files.  If you use it to get
fpObjc files, the filter information will be ignored.</li>

	  <li> <a href=spectro.fit>FITS Binary Table (.fit) </a> for
spectro data.  This contains plate, mjd, fiberID, and rerun information,
and can be used to get spSpec files.</li>

	</ul>
	</li>

<li> <b>Select the file to upload:</b> Once you have a file, either
type in its name, or browse to find it on your local computer.</li>

<li> <b>Select the transfer format:</b>

<p>The recommended option is for the DAS to create an rsync include file,
to be used with rsync (see
    the <a href=http://samba.anu.edu/rsync/documentation.html>rsync
website</a>) which will copy over all the files you requested directly
via a command line interface.  Since the rsync command requires no
overhead for combining the requested files into an archive (.tar,
.tar.gz, or .zip) file and since it only copies files which do not
exist or have changed on your local machine, it is the preferred
method for transferring large numbers of files.  Due to this
consideration, any request for more than 10 files will default to the
rsync option.  Rsync is freely downloadable from the <a
href=http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/download.html>rsync download page</a>.
Windows users will also need to download Cygwin, which is also freely
downloadable from the <a href=http://www.cygwin.com/>Cygwin web
site</a>, in order to run rsync.</p>

<p>    There are three further options for transferring the data,
    which are, however, only available for small data sets (up to 10
    files) to prevent large requests from locking up the DAS.  UNIX
users will likely wish to use either a .tar or a .tar.gz archive file
containing the files requested, and Windows users will probably want a
.zip archive file.  </p></li>

<li> <b>Submit:</b> Self-explanatory.</li>

</ol>

<h2>What happens next? </h2>

<p>If you chose the .tar, .tar.gz, or .zip transfer format options -- <i>
and if you requested 10 or fewer files</i> -- a script runs which
looks for all of the files you requested, makes an archive of them,
prepares a listing of the files, and presents you with a web page
where you can download the archive.  It will look something like this:</p>

<pre><b>SDSS Data Archive Server Download Results </b>
      Use your browser to download the results file /data/dp7.c/FFD/FFD_16051_1018557741/sdss_product/imaging.tar.gz<p>
      The file is 307354 bytes.<p>
      SDSS wrapper report Thu Apr 11 15:42:22 CDT 2002 Version v13_31 
      Total number of bytes to be written:  398886
               132256 1356/21/objcs/3/fpM-001356-r3-0086.fit.gz
               128899 1356/21/objcs/3/fpM-001356-r3-0087.fit.gz
               137731 1356/21/objcs/3/fpM-001356-r3-0088.fit.gz </pre>
(NOTE: The above is example output.  Actual results files are removed
from our system daily.)

<P>

If you chose the rsync transfer format option, <i> or if you
requested more than 10 files</i>, you will obtain a page describing
how you can transfer them to your computer using rsync by using the
rsync include file the DAS creates:

<a name="rsync_command">
<pre>
<strong>SDSS Data Archive Server Results (dr1)</strong>
You have requested X FITS, postscript, and/or gif files.

Use <code>rsync</code> to download the files (see our <a href="./rsync.html">rsync help page</a>).

<code>rsync</code> will mirror the data archive directories containing the files
you have requested on your disk.

In the directory where you would like the directories containing your data to be placed, 
save <a href=./sdss-rsync.lis>this link as sdss-rsync.lis</a>
and type:

        rsync -vtrLPR rsync://dr1@rsync.sdss.org/DR1/ ./ --include-from=sdss-rsync.lis
</pre>
The rsync password you will need is "dr1". There are three ways to specify the password:
<ul>
  <li>Type the password when prompted after issuing the rsync command.</li>
  <li>First set an environment variable RSYNC_PASSWORD to the password, then issue the rsync command</li>
  <li>First save the password in a file, then tell rsync its location with
      the option --password-file=FILENAME</li>
</ul>


<h2> What if it does not work? </h2>

Please run one of the examples to see if the server is functional.
Then please check your file to confirm you have it formatted
correctly.  Send an email to <a
href="mailt:sdss-helpdesk@fnal.gov">sdss-helpdesk@fnal.gov</a>and
include the following:
<ul>
  <li>your query or upload file</li>
  <li>the timestamp and directory name at the top of the results page
      (a line like <code>Begin access on Fri Feb 28 11:46:45 CST 2003
      at /data/dp7.a/webscratch/DAS_21769_1046454405</code></li>
  <li>the URL of the particular DAS webserver you are using</li>
  <li>the version of DP that the DAS webserver was using;
    this is listed at the bottom of the DAS query form
    (e.g., "DP Version: dp v14_207;" or 
    "DP Version: -r /usrdevel/dp2/dtucker/dp dp;")
</UL>
We keep usage logs for each access, sorted by date, and this
information will help us track down trouble.

<h2> What Data Are Available? </h2>

Sky coverage for DR1 is described on the <a
href=../coverage/coverage.html>DR1 coverage page</a>.

<P>

See also the <a href=http://das.sdss.org/DR1/data/imaging/>imaging</a>
and <a href=http://das.sdss.org/DR1/data/spectro/>spectro</a> root
directories for more information.

<h2> Do I have to use the Web Interface?</h2>

No, there are other ways to get at the data.  One way is to use the
rsync command from your computers command line <a href=#rsync_command>
as described above </a>using an appropriate include file like
<a href=./sdss-rsync.lis>sdss-rsync.lis</a>.  In additional, other
methods of access are described on the <a
href=../access/index.html> DR1 Data Access
Page</a>.
