title: First Light Image
caption: \
A small section of the first-light image obtained by the Sloan Digital \
Sky Survey on the night of May 27-28, 1998.  The overall image is over \
5,000 times larger than this small piece of the constellation Serpens. \
The photo was assembled from digital scans taken through separate \
filters.  (The individual colors provide valuable information for \
identifying the objects.)  It also shows stars in our own galaxy (the \
brighter ones are recognizable by the cross pattern), a half-dozen \
distant galaxies near enough to show morphological features like disks \
and rings, and many fainter and farther galaxies, distinguished from \
stars by their slightly fuzzy appearance.

title: NGC 6070
caption: \
The large bright galaxy, called NGC 6070, lies in the constellation of \
Serpens.  It is receding from the Earth with a velocity of about 2000 \
kilometers per second and is at a distance of over 100 million light \
years.  The blue light in the galaxy comes from recently formed hot \
stars; the yellowish light comes from cooler, older stars.  Several \
other galaxies are also visible.  The point-like images are stars in \
our own Milky Way Galaxy.

title: Palomar 5
caption: \
This is the globular cluster Palomar 5, which is a cluster \
of stars orbiting the Milky Way at a distance of 210 thousand light \
years.  Most of the fainter stars in the picture belong the to cluster; \
the brighter stars are foreground stars elsewhere in the Milky Way.

id: mosaic
caption: \
This is a mosaic of a region of the sky 2.5 degrees on a side.  Two \
separate sweeps of the sky were made on successive nights with the \
2.5-meter telescope and its mosaic camera.  The 6 columns of CCDs in the \
camera collect data from 6 scanlines on the sky separated by small \
gaps.  By offseting the telescope a small amount between the two runs, \
the scanlines from the two runs can be interleaved to form a seamless \
map of a complete section of the sky.</p> \

While this image may look small and unimpressive, consider that the \
width of the \
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/19980608.fl.img1.html">\
first light image</a> is about the same as the width of one of those 12 \
vertical strips.</p> \
<p>This image is also available as a \
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/data/mosaic/frame.html">clickable, \
zoom-in map.</a>

id: dust
title: Interstellar Dust
caption: \
This image has been contrast-enhanced to reveal fainter features. \
The mottled background is due to starlight reflecting off \
interstellar dust in the Milky Way.  The patchy appearance is due \
to the fact that the dust has a irregular distribution.

title: Redshift 5.0 Quasar
caption: \
The arrow in this image points out the record-breaking redshift 5.0 \
quasar discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  That faint red dot \
of light represents an object that is actually a hundred times as \
luminous as a typical galaxy.  Sky Survey astronomers identified this \
object as a possible high-redshift quasar on the basis of its \
exceptionally red color compared to ordinary stars and galaxies. \
Followup spectroscopy with the ARC 3.5-meter telescope confirmed that \
this unassuming speck was indeed the most distant quasar known to date.

title: Redshift 4.9 Quasar
caption: \
This newly-discovered redshift 4.9 quasar was "only" the runner-up to \
the title of most distant quasar ever found (the previous non-SDSS \
title holder was announced in 1991).  However, it demonstrates the \
excellent performance of the Sky Survey's data analysis pipelines. \
These automated algorithms can accurately distinguish the light of the \
faint quasar from the foreground galaxy that can be seen only five \
arcseconds away.

title: Redshift 4.75 Quasar
caption: \
While this redshift 4.75 quasar may not be the most distant quasar \
known, it was first among its high-redshift brethren to be identified by \
Sloan Digital Sky Survey researchers.  This photometric image from \
September can't reveal the most remarkable feature of the quasar, \
namely that the Lyman-alpha and Carbon-IV spectral emission peaks are \
unusually narrow compared to an average quasar.

title: Spiral Galaxy NGC 1087 (6.7 arcmin x 4.8 arcmin)
caption: \
The spiral galaxy NGC 1087 is found in the constellation Cetus, and has \
a recession velocity of about 1520 kilometers per second.  This galaxy's \
most notable physical feature is a short rotating bar-like structure of \
bright stars straddling the galactic center.  Although it has a \
comparatively low surface brightness, the galaxy shone just a bit more \
brilliantly in August 1995 when one of its massive stars exploded into a \
Type II supernova.

title: M78 Nebula (12.0 arcmin x 8.8 arcmin)
caption: \
NGC 2068 (also known as M78) is a reflection nebula in the Orion \
constellation.  Hot young stars in the nebula's center illuminate and \
(to a much lesser extent) ionize the surrounding gas.  Further out, dark \
clouds of dust prevent much of the scattered light from reaching us, \
creating a complex pattern of light and shadow.  This star-forming \
region is only about 100,000 years old.

title: Spiral Galaxy UGC 03214 (12.3 arcmin x 8.8 arcmin)
caption: \
The constellation of Orion is home to the edge-on spiral galaxy UGC \
03214, which is receding from us at the rate of 4840 kilometers per \
second (about one-sixtieth the speed of light).  The brilliant central \
bulge stands in stark contrast to the light-absorbing bands of dust \
clouds in the disk.  When interpreting observations, astronomers often \
need to account for the obscuring and reddening effects of similar dust \
clouds in our own galaxy.

title: Spectrum of Redshift 5.0 Quasar
caption: \
This graph shows part of the spectrum of the record-breaking quasar with \
a redshift of 5.0.  One of the identifying characteristics of quasars is \
the large Lyman-alpha emission peak, a feature that would appear in the \
ultraviolet part of the spectrum if the source were not redshifted.  For \
this particular quasar, the peak lies in the near infrared just beyond \
the range of human vision -- a factor of six increase in the wavelength. \
Aside from this extreme redshift, the spectrum otherwise is very similar \
to those of more nearby quasars.

title: Redshift 5.74 Quasar
caption: \
The arrow in this image points a record-shattering redshift of 5.74. SDSS astronomers identified \
this faint speck of light as a possible quasar based on its distinctive \
red color. A spectrum of this object, obtained with the 10-meter Keck \
telescope in Hawaii, showed that this was indeed a quasar with a most \
impressive redshift.

title: Redshift 5.8 Quasar Spectrum
caption: \
This graph shows part of the spectrum of the most distant quasar \
currently known, with a redshift of 5.8. The large peak is called the \
Lyman-alpha emission peak, and is a distinguishing feature of quasar \
spectra. This spectral feature would normally appear in the ultraviolet, \
with a wavelength of about 1200 Angstroms. For this quasar, the \
Lyman-alpha peak appears in the infrared around 8300 Angstroms, \
representing a nearly sevenfold increase in the wavelength due to the \
expansion of the universe.

title: Redshift 6.4 Quasar
caption: \
The red dot in this picture is the most distant quasar ever \
discovered (at least as of October 2003). The redshift 6.4 quasar is seen at a \
time when the universe was just 800 million years old. The \
light-travel time from this object to us is about 13 billion years.
