title: Redshift 4.16 QSO
caption: \
The spectrum of a QSO at a redshift (z) of 4.16.  The emission line \
fitting algorithm correctly identified the redshifted Lyman alpha peak, \
as well as the nitrogen, silicon, oxygen and carbon emission features \
just redward.  Note that the software regarded much of the Lyman alpha \
forest as unidentifiable emission lines, but still calculated a correct \
redshift.  The Survey will obtain spectra for roughly 100,000 QSO's, \
although most will be at lower redshift than this one.

title: Redshift 3.7 QSO
caption: \
A QSO with broad absorption at z~3.7.  Again, 1d correctly identified \
the emission features, although the broad absorption caused an error of \
about 0.05 in redshift.

# Galaxies

id: g0312-255
title: Typical galaxy
caption: \
A galaxy at redshift 0.1234.  These "typical" galaxies' redshifts are \
usually fit by identifying the calcium H and K lines in conjunction with \
the strong magnesium and sodium lines at 5178 and 5891 Angstroms, \
respectively.  Strong absorption in hydrogen and the G band can also be \
seen in this spectrum.  At the end of its run, the Survey will have \
spectra for approximately one million such galaxies.

title: Bright red galaxy
caption: \
This is an example of an SDSS Bright Red Galaxy (BRG).  These galaxies \
are typically elliptical galaxies at a redshift of 0.25 to 0.5, targeted \
for spectroscopy due to their red color in the imaging portion of the \
Survey.  This galaxy, at a redshift of 0.3762, has especially prominent \
magnesium and sodium absorption.

title: Emission-line galaxy
caption: \
An emission-line galaxy with z=0.0886.  The prominent features of such a \
galaxy are now in emission, not absorption.  SDSS software fits the \
redshifts for these galaxies by identifying the various hydrogen, \
nitrogen II, sodium II, and oxygen III lines.

# Stars

id: g0312-371
title: DA white dwarf
caption: \
Although the SDSS is primarily an extragalactic survey, spectra will be \
obtained for some 100,000 stars.  This is a typical DA white dwarf, as \
identified by its very broad hydrogen absorption features.

title: Cool red M star
caption: \
Many of the stars to be observed within the Survey are cool red stars \
such as this M star.  These stars are easily identified by their low \
flux in the blue portion of the spectrum and clear titanium oxide \
absorption bands towards the red end.

id: g0315-422
title: Carbon star
caption: \
Through sheer number of objects observed, the SDSS will help advance the \
field of stellar astronomy.  Here is an example of a carbon star, a \
"rare" star which lies away from the main stellar sequence.  The strong \
absorption bands in the blue half of the spectrum are due to absorption \
by molecular carbon.
