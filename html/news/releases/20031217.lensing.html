Sloan Digital Sky Survey scientists have discovered a gravitationally lensed 
quasar with the largest separation ever recorded, and, contrary to 
expectations, found that four of the most distant, most luminous quasars known are not 
gravitationally lensed.<BR>
<BR>

Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity predicts that the 
gravitational pull of a massive body can act as a lens, bending and distorting the light 
of a distant object.  A massive structure somewhere between a distant quasar 
and Earth can "lens" the light of a quasar, making the image substantially 
brighter and producing several images of one object.  <BR>
<BR>

In a paper published in the December 18/25 edition of NATURE magazine, a 
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) team led by University of Tokyo graduate students 
Naohisa Inada and Masamune Oguri report that four quasars in close proximity 
are, in fact, the light from one quasar split into four images by gravitational 
lensing.<BR>

A new gravitational lens discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The 
detailed picture, taken by the Subaru Telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea in 
Hawaii, shows four images of the same quasar (the four white dots in the center). 
The quasar is almost 10 billion light years from us and its light has been 
split into four by the gravitational influence of a foreground cluster of 
galaxies, "only" 6.2 billion light years away.  Some of the galaxies of the cluster 
appear as yellow dots on the image. </h4>

More than 80 gravitationally lensed quasars have been discovered since the 
first example was found in 1979. A dozen of the cataloged lensed quasars are 
SDSS discoveries, of which half are the result of the work of Inada and his team.<BR>
<BR>

But what makes this latest finding so dramatic is that the separation between 
the four images is twice as large as that of any previously known 
gravitationally lensed quasar. Until the discovery of this quadruple lens quasar, the 
largest separation known in a gravitationally lensed quasar was 7 arcseconds. The 
quasar found by the SDSS team lies in the constellation Leo Minor; it 
consists of four images separated by 14.62 arcseconds.<BR>
<BR>

In order to produce such a large separation, the concentration of matter 
giving rise to the lensing has to be particularly high. There is a cluster of 
galaxies in the foreground of this gravitational lens; the dark matter associated 
with the cluster must be responsible for the unprecedented large separation.<BR>
<BR>

"Additional observations obtained at the Subaru 8.2 meter telescope and
Keck telescope confirmed that this system is indeed a gravitational lens," 
explains Inada. "Quasars split this much by gravitational lensing are predicted 
to be very rare, and thus can only be discovered in very large surveys like 
the SDSS." <BR>
<BR>

Oguri added: "Discovering one such wide gravitational lens out of over 30,000 
SDSS quasars surveyed to date is perfectly consistent with theoretical 
expectations of models in which the universe is dominated by cold dark matter.  This 
offers additional strong evidence for such models." (Cold dark matter, unlike 
hot dark matter, forms tight clumps, the kind that causes this kind of 
gravitational lens.)<BR>
<BR>

"The gravitational lens we have discovered will provide an ideal laboratory 
to explore the relation between visible objects and invisible dark matter in 
the universe," Oguri explained.<BR>
<BR>

In a second paper to be published in the Astronomical Journal in March 2004, 
a team led by Gordon Richards of Princeton University used the high resolution 
of the Hubble Space Telescope to examine four of the most distant known 
quasars discovered by SDSS for signs of gravitational lensing. <BR>
<BR>

Looking to great distances in astronomy is looking back in time. These 
quasars are seen at a time when the universe was less than 10percent of its present 
age. These quasars are tremendously luminous, and are thought to be powered by 
enormous black holes with masses several billion times that of the Sun. The 
researchers said it is a real mystery how such massive black holes could have 
formed so early in the universe.  Yet if these objects are gravitationally 
lensed, SDSS researchers would infer substantially smaller luminosities and 
therefore black hole masses, making it easier to explain their formation.<BR>
<BR>

"The more distant a quasar, the more likely a galaxy lies between it and the 
viewer. This is why we expected the most distant quasars to be lensed," 
explained SDSS researcher Xiaohui Fan of the University of Arizona. However, 
contrary to expectations, none of the four shows any sign of multiple images that is 
the hallmark of lensing. <BR>
<BR>

"Only a small fraction of quasars are gravitationally lensed. However, 
quasars this bright are very rare in the distant universe. Since lensing causes 
quasars to appear brighter and therefore easier to detect, we expected that our 
distant quasars were the ones most likely to be lensed," suggested team member 
Zoltan Haiman of Columbia University.  <BR>
<BR>

"The fact that these quasars are not lensed says that astronomers have to take
 seriously the idea that quasars a few billion times the mass of the Sun 
formed less than a billion years after the Big Bang", said Richards.  "We're now 
looking for more examples of high-redshift quasars in the SDSS to give 
theorists even more supermassive black holes to explain."<BR>
