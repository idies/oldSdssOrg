Sky Survey Unveils Star Cluster 
Shredded By The Milky Way <br>
</b></font>
<font size="4">
<p><b>
Albuquerque, N.M. -- A team of astronomers from the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey (SDSS) collaboration has discovered a spectacular stream of stellar 
debris emanating from a star cluster that is being torn apart by the 
Milky Way. 
</b></p>
<p>
Dr. Michael Odenkirchen and Dr. Eva Grebel from the Max Planck Institute 
for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany, are presenting these findings 
today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico. 
The detection of this stream, the first of its kind, supports theorists' 
view that star clusters get destroyed by the tidal forces of the Milky Way. 
Researchers say such extended streams of tidal debris provide a new way 
to determine the mass distribution of the dark matter halo of our Galaxy.
</p>
<p>
The stars in the newly discovered stream are being torn from an ancient 
globular cluster named Palomar 5, which is located in the outer part of 
our Galaxy 75,000 light years away from the Sun.  While typical globular 
clusters are massive, luminous concentrations of some hundred thousand 
stars,  Palomar 5 by comparison looks faint and diffuse and contains only 
about ten thousand stars.
This led astronomers to suspect that Palomar 5 might be a likely victim  
of the disruptive tides of the Milky Way. These ``tides'' arise because the 
Milky Way's gravitational pull is stronger on the cluster's near side than 
on the far side, thus tearing the cluster apart. However, the telltale 
debris from the disruption was difficult to find since it is hidden in a 
sea of foreground and background objects.
</p>
<p>
Using data from the SDSS and a special filtering technique, Odenkirchen 
and his collaborators have succeeded in making the stream of debris from 
Palomar 5 directly visible.
``The excellent homogeneity, resolution, depth, and multi-color
information of the SDSS observations have allowed us to separate faint 
former members of Palomar 5 from contaminating field stars and background
galaxies,'' says Odenkirchen, who is a postdoctoral researcher at the MPIA.
</p>
<p>
The SDSS is an international project that is creating a deep map of one 
quarter of the sky in five colors.
The SDSS records objects up to 10 million times fainter than the faintest 
stars visible with the naked eye.  
The observations are carried out with a special wide-field camera 
on a dedicated 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico.
Team member Dr. Connie Rockosi of the University of Washington was one of 
the builders of the camera.
</p>
<p>
First direct evidence for the tidal disruption of Palomar 5 emerged two 
years ago from SDSS commissioning data that happened to include Palomar 5.
Odenkirchen and collaborators were amazed to recover the characteristic 
S-shape signature of tidal debris from these data.
``This was the first time that tidal tails of a star cluster were seen 
with convincing clarity", says Grebel, an astronomer 
who leads the Galactic structure group at MPIA.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the SDSS has scanned a much larger region on the sky.
Analyzing the new data the researchers found that the two tails 
emanating from Palomar 5 extend over an arc of ten degrees on the sky.
This vast area corresponds to 20 times the diameter of the full moon 
on the sky or to a length of 13,000 light years in space.
``Remarkably, we now find more mass in the tails than in the remaining 
cluster. We expect to detect the stream over an even larger area as 
the survey progresses,'' Odenkirchen said.
</p>
<p>
The tails of Palomar~5 delineate the orbital path of this cluster 
and thus provide a unique opportunity to determine its motion around 
the Milky Way. ``The motions of objects orbiting the Galactic halo are 
still poorly known. It normally takes decades to measure even only the 
instantaneous displacement of a globular cluster on the sky,'' Grebel 
points out.
``Finding additional coherent streams that extend over large portions
of the sky we would be able to reconstruct Galactic orbits independent 
of a specific Galactic model,'' says the MPIA's Dr. Walter Dehnen, who 
carried out extensive numerical simulations on the disruption of Palomar~5. 
The researchers expect that the geometry and the velocities of those tidal 
streams will become important tools for determining the mass of the dark 
matter halo of the Milky Way.
<p>
<p>
Together with the so-called Sagittarius stream, which emerges from a 
dwarf galaxy that is currently being accreted by the Milky Way, there 
are now two different examples of extended stream-like structures in 
the Galactic halo.  
Computer simulations suggest that globular clusters were much more 
numerous in the early days of the Milky Way,
and that many of them have already been shredded by Galactic tides.
As the survey proceeds the SDSS researchers will be able to test this
prediction by searching for signs of tidal mass loss around other 
globular clusters.
``The SDSS data base will ultimately allow us to estimate the total 
number of such streams,'' says Professor Hans-Walter Rix, director of
the MPIA. ``This will clarify the role of tidal disruption 
in the build-up of the Galactic halo and provide a crucial test for 
galaxy formation models.''
