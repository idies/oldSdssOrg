This newly-discovered redshift 4.9 quasar is "only" the runner-up to the
title of most distant quasar ever found (the previous title holder, now
in third place, was announced in 1991).  However, it demonstrates the
excellent performance of the Sky Survey's data analysis pipelines.
These automated algorithms can accurately distinguish the light of the
faint quasar from the foreground galaxy that can be seen only five
arcseconds away.
