This is an image showing the first methane dwarf, discovered by Xiaohui
Fan and Michael Strauss of Princeton University.  This cool brown dwarf
is about 30 light-years away, in the constellation Ophiuchus.  The
presence of methane in the atmosphere of this extremely cool object was
shown in spectra taken in the 1 to 2.5 micron region at the United
Kingdom Infrared Telescope by Sandy Leggett (UKIRT) and Tom Geballe
(Gemini).
