Sky survey lowers estimate of asteroid impact risk<br>
<p>Princeton, N.J. -- The odds of earth suffering a catastrophic
collision with an asteroid over the next century are about one in
5,000, which is less likely than previously believed, according to
research published this month.  </p>
<p>Astronomers using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey found that
the solar system contains about 700,000 asteroids big enough to
destroy civilization. That figure is about one-third the size of
earlier estimates, which had put the number at around two million and
the odds of collision at roughly one in 1,500 over a one hundred-year
period.</p>
<p>"Our estimate for the chance of a big impact contains some of the same
uncertainties as previous estimates, but it is clear that we should
feel somewhat safer than we did before we had the Sloan survey data,"
said lead researcher Zeljko Ivezic of Princeton University.</p>
<p>The results were published in the November issue of the Astronomical
Journal.</p>
<p>The new estimate draws on observations of many more asteroids,
particularly small faint ones, than were available in previous impact
risk estimates, said Ivezic. The ability to detect faint objects in
large numbers is a hallmark of the Sloan survey, a multi-institutional
collaboration that is mapping one-quarter of the sky. While its main
purpose is to look at objects outside our galaxy, the survey also
records images of closer objects that cross the view of its telescope,
which is located at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.</p>
<p>The survey data also allowed the astronomers to gauge the size of
asteroids with improved accuracy, which required categorizing the
objects by their composition. Asteroids with a surface of carbon --
looking like giant lumps of coal -- are darker than those made of
rock. A small rocky asteroid therefore looks just as bright as a much
larger one made of carbon.</p>
<p>"You don't know precisely the size of an object you are looking at
unless you know what type it is," Ivezic said, noting that the Sloan
survey provides information about the color of objects, which allows
astronomers to distinguish between carbon and rock.</p>
<p>Based on observations of 10,000 asteroids, the researchers estimated
that the asteroid belt contains about 700,000 that are bigger than one
kilometer (six-tenths of a mile) in diameter, which is the minimum
size thought to pose a catastrophic risk to humans and other
species. The asteroid belt is the source for a smaller group of
asteroids called "near- earth objects," which have broken from the
belt and have the potential to collide with earth. Although they did
not specifically observe near earth objects, the researchers believe
that their census of main belt asteroids reveals the likelihood of
collisions with similarly sized near-earth asteroids.</p>
<p>Ivezic noted that the new impact risk estimate, like most previous
ones, relies on assumptions about a single event 65 million years ago
when a 10-kilometer asteroid collided with earth and killed the
dinosaurs. The researchers assumed that such impacts occur on roughly
100 million-year intervals and used that statistic to calculate the
impact odds for the more common asteroids of smaller sizes.  This
calculation required knowing how much more common one-kilometer
asteroids are than 10-kilometer ones, which was hard to measure before
the Sloan data was available.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of uncertainty when you have a sample of only one
event," Ivezic said, referring to the dinosaur-killing impact. "But
this is the best information we have."</p>
<p>Previous studies could detect only asteroids five kilometers or
larger, so astronomers had to extrapolate to estimate the number of
smaller ones, said Ivezic. The Sloan researchers found that this
approach produced high estimates. When they could actually observe
them, the small asteroids were not as plentiful as had been expected
from observations of large ones.</p>
<p>The reason for this reduced number of smaller asteroids is an open
question, which, if answered, may offer important clues about the
history of the solar system and the factors that shaped the asteroid
belts, said team member Serge Tabachnik of Princeton.</p>
<p>Another valuable piece of information for scientists is the
observation that the rock and carbon asteroids are separated into two
bands, said co-author Tom Quinn of the University of Washington. The
heart of the rocky asteroid belt is 260 million miles from the sun,
while the other is 300 million miles from the sun. The sun and earth,
by comparison, are 93 million miles apart.</p>
<p>The astronomers attribute much of the success of the study to software
that automatically identifies asteroids from among the millions of
images observed by the Sloan survey. Independent tests by Mario Juric
from the University of Zagreb, Croatia, have shown that the Sloan
software finds at least nine of every ten asteroids.</p>
<p>"We have only five minutes to follow the motion of an asteroid as it
passes in front of the telescope," said Robert Lupton, a Princeton
researcher who developed the software for automatic detection of
asteroids. "But we have found that we detect them very efficiently and
reliably." Lupton said the team benefited greatly from software for
finding the positions and relative movements of objects, developed by
Jeff Pier, Jeff Munn, Robert Hindsley and Greg Hennessy of the
U.S. Naval Observatory.</p>
<p>"The Sloan study is a major advance in our understanding of the gross
asteroid belt structure," said Robert Jedicke, an asteroid expert at
the University of Arizona. "Their determination of the Earth impact
rate for killer asteroids agrees with soon-to-be-published results
based on data from the Spacewatch Project at the University of
Arizona." The Arizona team based its risk estimate on a study of
near-earth objects, rather than main belt asteroids.</p>
