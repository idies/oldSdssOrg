Asteroid Image

This is a composite color image produced by combining the <i>g</i>,
<i>r</i> and <i>i</i> filter images which are color coded as blue, green
and red respectively.  A few ordinary stars are seen as orange and
white-blue dots. The two extended yellow objects near the bottom of the
image are galaxies.  The three blue, green and red dots near the center
are the detections of an asteroid.  Since the asteroid was at a
different position when each of the three frames were taken, it appears
as three stars with very unnatural colors.  The distance between the red
and blue dot is three times as large as the distance between the green
and red dot because the time between the exposures in the <i>i</i> and
<i>g</i> bands is three times as large (216 seconds) as the time between
the <i>r</i> and <i>i</i> exposures (72 seconds).  This motion is a
give-away sign that is used to distinguish asteroids from stationary
stars.
