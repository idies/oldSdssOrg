<h2>SDSS-II Supernova Survey explodes with new findings</h2>

<P>WASHINGTON &mdash; The population of supernovae &mdash; exploding
stars in distant galaxies &mdash; has exploded here on Earth with an
unprecedented number of new discoveries logged in just 90 days by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).</P>

<P>The
Sloan Supernova Survey today reported the discovery of 139 new Type
Ia supernovae during its first campaign last fall.</P>

<P>These
supernovae will be used to provide more precise constraints on the
nature of the mysterious Dark Energy that is causing the expansion of
the Universe to speed up. They will also yield greater understanding
of supernovae as standard distance signposts (aka standard candles or
standard light bulbs) in the Universe.</P>

<P>&quot;Finding
so many supernovae in such a short time is unprecedented, because the
SDSS probes a larger volume of space than previous surveys,&quot;
explained supernova team co-leader Joshua Frieman of the Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and the University of
Chicago.  The results were made public during a session on Supernovae
and Cosmology at the American Astronomical Society's winter meeting
in Washington, DC.</P>

<P>To
find supernovae, the team used the dedicated SDSS-II 2.5-meter
telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. Its
120-megapixel CCD camera is used to scan the same part of the sky
roughly every other night over a three-month period, searching for
supernovae that explode in any of the three million galaxies it sees.
Comparing images taken on different nights, astronomers can look for
objects that have brightened over time &mdash; potential supernovae. Shortly
after it explodes, a supernova becomes as bright as an entire galaxy,
so it can be seen across vast cosmic distances.</P>

<P>&quot;An
advantage of the SDSS is that it carries out nearly simultaneous
imaging in five different portions of the optical spectrum, providing
measurements of the colors as well as the brightness of objects,&quot;
explained Masao Sako of Stanford University.  Using these colors,
Sako and other members of the SDSS-II supernova team were able to
zero in with very high efficiency on the prized Type Ia supernovae,
the most precise standard candles.</P>

<P>The
most promising Type Ia candidates were targeted for follow-up
spectroscopy on a variety of other telescopes, including the
Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-meter telescope, the
Hobby-Eberly 9.2-meter telescope in Texas, the William Herschel
4.2-meter telescope in the Canary Islands, Japan's Subaru 8.2-meter
telescope, Keck 10-meter telescope in Hawaii and the MDM Hiltner
2.4-meter telescope in Arizona.</P>

<P>&quot;Follow
up observations that measure the spectrum of the supernova are
critical,&quot; explained team member John Marriner of Fermilab.
&quot;First, they confirm that the candidate is a Type Ia rather than
some other kind of supernova, and second, they determine the velocity
at which it is receding from the Earth.&quot;  That recession velocity
is caused by the expansion of the Universe; by combining the
brightnesses and recession velocities of large numbers of supernovae,
astronomers can unravel the history of the cosmic expansion rate.</P>

<P>Since
supernovae are bright only for a few weeks, the candidates must be
identified quickly so that their spectra can be measured before they
fade. A cluster of 10 dual-processor computers at the observatory
automatically processes the data and looks for differences between
the images just taken and those of the same part of the sky in
previous years.</P>

<P>&quot;A
full night of data collection with the telescope yields about 2,400
images, each one roughly equivalent to the image in a four-megapixel
digital camera.  We process these images with our computers in about
20 hours,&quot; explained supernova researcher Richard Kessler of the
University of Chicago. &quot;This accumulation of 70 gigabytes of images
each night is equal to more than 100 CDs or 15 DVDs.&quot;</P>

<P>The
new supernova sample also bridges the gap between the nearby
supernovae found in local surveys and the very distant objects found
by deeper surveys of much smaller areas. &quot;The combination of a
2.5-meter aperture and a very large field of view makes the SDSS
telescope ideal for finding intermediate distance supernovae, about 1
to 3 billion light years from Earth,&quot; explained Jon Holtzman of New
Mexico State University. &quot;Only a handful of supernovae at these
distances had been found previously.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;All
of the well-known results on the accelerating universe have so far
come from comparing nearby supernovae to distant supernovae that were
discovered and measured in different kinds of surveys,&quot; added
Frieman. &quot;The SDSS-II survey fills in the missing rungs on the
ladder.&quot;</P>

<P>The
race to improve the quality of supernova samples over a range of
distances is heating up.</P>

<P>&quot;The
Sloan Supernova Legacy Survey and the ESSENCE survey are compiling
more distant samples that will include hundreds of supernovae by the
time they each finish a few years from now,&quot; noted Craig Hogan of
the University of Washington. &quot;Combining the SDSS results with
these deeper surveys will probe the cosmic expansion and the nature
of the dark energy with greater precision.&quot; (ESSENCE is a five-year
supernova survey designed to constrain the physics of Dark Energy

<P>The
SDSS researchers are also looking forward to some surprises in the
&quot;astronomical zoo.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;We
focused on the type Ia supernovae this season, because of the
exciting cosmology applications, but the SDSS gives us a unique tool
to study unusual supernova types,&quot; noted Stanford University's
Roger Romani. &quot;We have shown that we can sift through hundreds of
new supernovae to select the rare gems. With a survey volume this
large, these rarities turn up frequently enough to allow serious
investigation of their place in the astronomical zoo.&quot;</P>

<P><b>Supernova background</b></P>

<P>Type
Ia Supernovae are formed when white dwarf stars - the remnants of
stars similar to our Sun -- collapse inward and blow up like an
atomic bomb in brief but intense bursts of energy. The white dwarf
accumulates gas from a companion star until it explodes, spewing gas
and particles of iron, nickel and cobalt. The brightness of the Type
Ia light peaks about three weeks after the explosion and declines
over a period of months.</P>

<P>In
the early 1990's, astronomers found that type Ia supernovae could be
used to study cosmological distances because they appear to be
accurate standard candles. In 1998, two research groups studying
distant type Ia supernovae found that they were fainter than would be
expected if the expansion of the Universe were slowing down due to
the attractive pull of gravity. Instead, the evidence, which has
since been confirmed by other cosmological observations, pointed to a
speed-up of the Universe that began a few billion years ago. The
cause of this acceleration is thought to be a bizarre form of energy,
dubbed dark energy, which permeates the Universe and acts as a source
of gravitational repulsion.</P>

<P>Information
about the newly discovered SDSS-II supernovae has been distributed to
the astronomical community via the International Astronomical Union
circulars and the Central Bureau for Electronic Telegrams. These
listings of supernova discovery dates, positions, magnitudes, and
list of co-authors helps the community perform follow-up research.

<P>The
Sloan Supernova Survey is one of three research and discovery
components of The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (II), which will run
through mid-2008.</P>
