    Colors of Quasars Reveal a Dusty Universe</h2>

    often show dark lanes of interstellar dust blocking light from the galaxy's stars,
    as in this image of the galaxy NGC 4565 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).
    The dust is formed in the outer regions of dying stars, and it drifts off to mix
    with interstellar gas.<br />
    <br />
    The new analysis of quasar colors shows that galaxies also expel dust to distances
    of several hundred thousand light years, ten times farther than the visible edge
    of the galaxy seen in this image. The thin haze of intergalactic dust dims and reddens
    the light from background quasars.

    The vast expanses of intergalactic space appear to be filled with a haze of tiny,
    smoke-like "dust" particles that dim the light from distant objects and subtly change their colors, according to
a team of astronomers from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).</p>
<p>
    "Galaxies contain lots of dust, most of it formed in the outer regions of dying
    stars," said team leader Brice M&eacute;nard of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical
    Astrophysics. "The surprise is that we are seeing dust hundreds of thousands of
    light-years outside of the galaxies, in intergalactic space."</p>
    
    <p>
    The new findings are reported in a paper titled "Measuring the galaxy-mass and galaxy-dust
    correlations through magnification and reddening," submitted to the journal <em>Monthly
    Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</em>, and posted today on the web site arXiv.org.</p>
<p>
    To discover this intergalactic dust, the team analyzed the colors of distant quasars
    whose light passes in the vicinity of foreground galaxies on its way to the Earth.</p>
    
    <p>
    Dust grains block blue light more effectively than red light, explained astronomer
    Ryan Scranton of the University of California, Davis,
another member of the discovery team. "We see this when the sun sets: light rays pass through a thicker layer of
    the atmosphere, absorbing more and more blue light, causing the sun to appear reddened.
    We find similar reddening of quasars from intergalactic dust, and this reddening
    extends up to ten times 
beyond the apparent edges of the galaxies themselves."</p>
<p>
    The team analyzed the colors of about 100,000 distant quasars located
    behind 20 million galaxies, using images from SDSS-II. "Putting
together and analyzing
    this huge dataset required cutting-edge ideas from computer science and statistics,"
    said team member Gordon Richards of Drexel University. "Averaging over so many objects
    allowed us to measure an effect that is much too small to see in any individual
    quasar."</p>        <p>Supernova explosions and "winds" from massive stars drive gas out of
some galaxies, M&eacute;nard explained, and this gas may carry dust with it. Alternatively,
    the dust may be pushed directly by starlight.</p>
    
    <p>"Our findings now provide a reference
    point for theoretical studies," said M&eacute;nard.</p>
<p>
    Intergalactic dust could also affect
    planned cosmological experiments that use supernovae to investigate the nature of
    "dark energy," a mysterious cosmic component responsible for the acceleration of
    the expansion of the universe.</p>
    
    <p>"Just like household dust, cosmic dust can be a nuisance,"
    said Scranton. "Our results imply that most distant supernovae are seen through
    a bit of haze, which may affect estimates of their distances."</p>
    
    <p> Intergalactic dust
    doesn't remove the need for dark energy to explain current supernova data, M&eacute;nard
    explained, but it may complicate the interpretation of future high-precision distance
    measurements. "These experiments are very ambitious in their goals," said M&eacute;nard,
    "and subtle effects matter."

<h3>About the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)</h3>

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious survey of the sky ever 
undertaken, involving more than 300 astronomers and engineers at 
25 institutions around the world.  SDSS-II, which began in 2005 and
finished observations in July, 2008, is comprised of three complementary 
projects.  The Legacy Survey completed the original SDSS map of 
half the northern sky, determining the positions, brightness, and 
colors of hundreds of millions of celestial objects and measuring 
distances to more than a million galaxies and quasars.  
SEGUE (Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding 
and Exploration) mapped the structure and stellar makeup of
the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Supernova Survey repeatedly scanned a 
stripe along the celestial equator to discover and measure supernovae
and other variable objects, probing the accelerating expansion of
the cosmos.  All three surveys were carried out with special purpose
instruments on the 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory,
in New Mexico.
