The "Field of Streams" &mdash; this image is a map of stars in the outer 
regions of the Milky Way 
covering about one-quarter of the night sky, as observed by the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II). The trails and streams that cross the image 
are stars torn from disrupted Milky Way satellites. The color corresponds 
to distance, with red being the most distant and blue being the closest. 
The large, forked feature is the Sagittarius stream, further away from us 
(lower left) and closer to us (middle right). Other features marked are 
the Monoceros ring and the as yet unidentified stream.<br>(Credit: Vasily
