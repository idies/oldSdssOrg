This figure displays our ever-increasing knowledge of the early universe.
The vertical axis is the age of the universe when the light left the most
distant known quasar; the horizonal axis is the date.  In the past 35 years
the era of the universe that we have been able to probe with quasars has
dropped in age by more than a factor of three, and now stands at less than
800 million years.
