Last Piece for Advanced New Telescope Heads for the Mountain
</h2>
<p>Apache Point, NM -- Scientists are preparing to ship the final
piece of an advanced telescope that will give astronomers their clearest
view yet of the large-scale structure of the universe.  When the delivery
truck pulls up on February 18 to unload a new spectrograph for the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey's telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New
Mexico, it will mark a milestone in the most ambitious sky-mapping
project ever undertaken.</p>
<p>An international team of astronomers from eight research institutions
will collaborate in the project, which will use a specially constructed
telescope located in New Mexico's Sacramento Mountains to produce an
unprecedented three-dimensional picture of the universe.</p>
<p>University of Washington engineers installed the Sky Survey
telescope's primary mirror in January.  And the final piece of the
telescope, the second of two spectrographs built at The Johns Hopkins
University, will arrive this month at Apache Point, said Alan Uomoto, a
Johns Hopkins astrophysicist heading up the team that designed and built
the spectrographic system.</p>
<p>"The spectrographs separate radiation from celestial objects into
individual bands, or colors," Uomoto said.  "The spectra reveal
important information about the objects emitting light, including their
distance and chemical composition.  Within the Sky Survey's planned
five-year lifetime, astronomers will catalog more galaxy spectra than
have been examined in the entire history of astronomy."</p>
<p>Besides its spectrographic capability, the Sky Survey's 2.5-meter
diameter telescope will incorporate another technological advance: at
its focus will be an array of charge-coupled devices, or CCDs, small
silicon chips that convert incoming light to electrical signals.  While
the typical large telescope has one, or at most a few, CCDs in its focal
plane, the Sky Survey telescope will contain 54 of the chips.</p>
<p>The camera for the Sky Survey telescope is the most complex imaging
instrument ever developed for astronomy.</p>
<p>"The tremendous increase in sensitivity provided by the camera will
yield a quantum jump in the quality of data about a very large section
of the sky," said Sky Survey project scientist Jim Gunn, a Princeton
University astronomer and leader of the team that developed the
camera.</p>
<p>The Sky Survey will produce a catalog of the positions and
brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects, as well as the
spectra for about a million galaxies and 100,000 quasars.  Ultimately,
the catalog produced by the Sky Survey will be available to the public
and to astronomers around the world for a wide range of future
studies.</p>
<p>"The Sky Survey catalog will be the astronomer's field guide to the
heavens for the next fifty years," said University of Washington
astrophysicist Bruce Margon, the Survey's scientific director.  "Our
only current comprehensive guide comes from the Palomar Sky Survey of
forty years ago.  That survey used photographic plates, making it fifty
times less sensitive than the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  It was in only
two colors, compared to our five, and of course it was not in digital
form."</p>
<p>The collaboration expects the telescope to receive first
light in May, and astronomers hope to be collecting useful data in about
a year, said James Crocker, director of program management for the
survey and research director of of the Johns Hopkins Center for the
Astrophysical Sciences.</p>
<p>Astronomers will use the images and spectra from the
telescope to learn the distances and locations of galaxies in order to
build the most complete three-dimensional map of the cosmos ever
attempted.  The map will provide clues to the overall structure and
evolution of the universe.</p>
<p>"We don't know how the universe developed into its present, clumpy
structure," said astrophysicist Michael Turner of the University of
Chicago and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, project spokesman for
the Survey.  "Our best explanations involve events that happened the
tiniest fraction of a second after the Big Bang and may involve the
unification of the forces of nature.  Thus, the Sky Survey may allow us
to peer not only into outer space but into the inner space at the heart
of the fundamental structure of matter."</p>
<p>The Sky Survey will systematically map one quarter of the sky,
providing a three-dimensional picture of the universe through a volume
100 times larger than that explored to date.</p>
<p>"People ask what is magic about the Sky Survey," said astronomer
Steve Kent, of Fermilab and the University of Chicago.  "The galaxies
that we will map are arranged in patterns of groups, clusters,
filaments, walls and voids of various sizes.  The volume of the universe
that we will survey is so big that the largest structures we might see
are in a state little changed from the primordial pattern laid down in
the earliest phases of the Big Bang."</p>
<p>Apache Point Observatory, site of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
telescope, is owned by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC), a
collaboration of seven research institutions, and operated by New Mexico
State University.  The Sky Survey collaboration includes scientists from
the University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study,
the Japan Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, Princeton
University, the United States Naval Observatory and the University of
Washington.  Funding for the project is provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of
Energy, Sky Survey member institutions, and others.</p>
<p>"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey represents a new way of doing
astronomy," said Professor of Astrophysics Tim Heckman of Johns Hopkins
University, the project's CEO.  "Traditionally, we have built
general-purpose telescopes, to be used by small groups in separate
studies.  But it is a big problem to map the universe.  It requires a
new approach, with specialized technology and instruments, and the
collaboration of large numbers of scientists."</p>
