<h3>FIRST LIGHT: ASTRONOMERS USE DISTANT QUASAR TO PROBE COSMIC 'DARK AGE,' UNIVERSE ORIGINS</h3>
<p>
Using light from the most distant object known, astronomers
have found traces of the first generation of atoms in the
universe, 14 billion light years from Earth. The observations
are the first of the cosmic "Dark Age" between the Big Bang
and the first visible stars and galaxies and allow
astronomers to set a date for the complete reionization of
the universe.
</p>
<p>
The observations, by Robert Becker of the University of
California, Davis, and the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, Xiaohui Fan of the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton, Michael Strauss of Princeton University, and
Rick White of the Space Telescope Science Institute, a team
of scientists with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, mark the
point when radiation from the first stars and quasars tore
apart and reionized -- the neutral hydrogen atoms that filled
space after the Big Bang.
</p>
<p>
"The history of these atoms has been part of the unknown
territory of cosmology," said UC Davis cosmologist Becker.
</p>
<p>
All space, time, and energy began with the Big Bang. As the
universe cooled, energy turned into matter. Quarks and
electrons, then protons and neutrons appeared in the first
minute. But at temperatures of 1 billion degrees, it was too
hot for complete atoms to form. Scientists have found that it
took another 300,000 years for the temperature to cool off
enough for whole atoms of hydrogen to appear.
</p>
<p>
The half billion years between the formation of these first
atoms and the creation of the most distant light-emitting
objects detected by astronomers remains shrouded in mystery.
Astronomers have dubbed this period the cosmic Dark Ages. We
do know, however, that all was not quiet in these early
times. Cosmic background radiation from the period of atom
formation shows that matter was smoothly distributed through
the universe, said Becker. By the end of the Dark Ages,
matter was clumped into massive structures such as the
billion-solar mass black holes powering the quasars detected
in the new observations.
</p>
<p>
In addition, while the Big Bang created only hydrogen, helium
and a trace amount of lithium, the quasar light reveals
traces of more complex atoms including carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen and silicon, all of which had to be cooked up in stars
out of the primordial material.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the Dark Ages, hydrogen atoms were ionized
again, or stripped into atomic nuclei and electrons. This
reionization was probably caused by ultraviolet light from
the first quasars and stars. Until now, the timing of this
reionization event has been uncertain.
</p>
<p>
In 1965, Jim Gunn and Bruce Peterson, then at the California
Institute of Technology predicted that the neutral atoms
would be detected by their light-absorbing signature,
creating a trough in the spectrum. Hydrogen atoms absorb all
the light at a particular, characteristic wavelength, Becker
said. If at least one part in a 100,000 of the hydrogen in
intergalactic space were made up of whole atoms, all the
light at this wavelength would be blocked, he said.
</p>
<p>
"Seeing the effects of neutral hydrogen in the spectrum of
this quasar is telling us that we're finally probing the
universe to a time when the first stars and quasars lit up,"
said Gunn, now at Princeton University and the project
scientist of the SDSS. "Scientists have been looking for this
for a very long time; it is tremendously gratifying that we
are finally seeing it."
</p>
<p>
Because light from objects that are distant in space and time
is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, the Gunn-
Peterson trough would also be shifted, Becker said. By
looking at where in the spectrum the trough occurred,
astronomers could tell how old those atoms were, he said.
</p>
<p>
To achieve this, astronomers have to look at objects billions
of light years away and therefore far back in time. But in 35
years, no one has been able to detect the Gunn-Peterson
effect, Becker said. The conclusion was that almost all of
the hydrogen in intergalactic space is ionized.
</p>
<p>
"Only now have we found a quasar that is far enough away,"
Becker said.
</p>
<p>
Using the powerful Keck telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii,
Becker and his colleagues detected the imprint of neutral
atoms on light from quasar J1030+0524. J1030 is the most
distant object yet found, at 14.5 billion light years from
Earth. It was discovered in April this year by the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey scientists, led by Fan.
</p>
<p>
The researchers spread out the recorded light into its
constituent wavelengths. They found that, over a region of
the spectrum corresponding to millions of years of cosmic
history, no light from the quasar gets through -- it is all
absorbed in intergalactic space.
</p>
<p>
"The culprits responsible are from the very first generation
of atoms. These observations provide our first glimpse at
truly primordial material, and constrain the time at which
the reionization of the universe took place," Becker said.
</p>
<p>
The results will be submitted to the Astronomical Journal.
The Keck observatory, which houses the world's largest
telescope, is jointly managed by the California Institute of
Technology, the University of California, and NASA. The Sloan
Digital Sky Survey aims to map in detail one quarter of the
sky and 200 million celestial objects. Funding for the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the participating institutions, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Japanese
Monbukagakusho, and the Max Planck Society. The Sloan Digital
Sky Survey is a joint project of The University of Chicago,
Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the Japan
Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins University, the Max-
Planck-Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), the Max-Planck-
Institute for Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State
University, Princeton University, the United States Naval
Observatory, and the University of Washington.
