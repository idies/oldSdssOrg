Methane Dwarf Spectrum

This graph shows the spectrum of the first methane dwarf detected by the
SDSS.  The object is distinguished by the presence of very strong
methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) absorption bands.  Absorption bands of water
are also seen in the near infrared.</p>
<p>The region of the spectrum at wavelengths below 1 micron was observed
with the 3.5-meter ARC telescope; the region above about a micron was
observed at the UKIRT 3.8-meter telescope by Sandy Leggett and Tom
Geballe.  UKIRT observations by Leggett and Geballe also confirmed the
nature of the second SDSS methane dwarf.
