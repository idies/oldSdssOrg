<p>
Using 20,000 stars observed by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS-II), an international team of astronomers has discovered 
that 
the outer Milky Way is a mix of two distinct components rotating in opposite 
directions.
</p><p>
"By examining the motions and chemical makeup of the stars, we can see
that the inner and outer halos are quite different beasts and they
probably formed in different ways at different times," explained
Daniela Carollo, a researcher at the Italy's Torino Observatory and
the Australian National University.
</p><p>
"Two stellar components in the halo of the Milky Way," the paper describing 
the discovery, appears in the December 12, 2007 edition of the journal Nature. 
In addition to Carollo, the lead author, the team's principal investigators 
include Timothy C. Beers of Michigan State University, John E. Norris of The 
Australian National University and Masashi Chiba of Japan's Tohoku University.
</p><p>
"Although it was once considered a single structure, an analysis of the 
20,000 stars from SDSS-II shows that the halo is clearly divisible into two, 
broadly overlapping components," explained Beers. "The discovery gives us a much 
clearer picture of the formation of the first objects in our Galaxy and in the 
entire Universe."
</p><p>
The discovery was a year in the making. Beers explained that Carollo came to 
Michigan State University in 2006 to carry out a straightforward comparison 
between SDSS-II measurements and data about the standard model of galaxy 
formation. "But as we looked at the velocity and chemical composition of the halo 
data more closely, the evidence for distinct inner and outer halos became 
unmistakable."
</p><p>
To get a sense of one dimension &#0151; rotational speed &#0151; examine our Sun. It is a 
part of a disk of stars orbiting around the center of the Galaxy at an 
astounding 500,000 miles per hour. The inner halo, located well outside the disk, 
rotates in the same direction, but more slowly, at 50,000 miles per hour. The 
outer halo, the most remote of these components, spins in the opposite 
direction, at about 100,000 miles per hour.
</p><p>
The difference in chemical composition opens another door to discovery of the 
Galaxy's birth. According to Carollo, inner-halo stars contain three times 
more heavy atoms &#0151; such as iron and calcium &#0151; than outer-halo stars. These heavy 
atoms were forged in early forming massive stars and ejected during the 
star's death&#0151; a supernova explosion. Later forming stars, such as those observed 
in this study, form from gas that has recorded the composition of all of the 
stellar generations that preceded it.
</p><p>
"Inner- and outer-halo stars both pass near the sun as they move through the 
Galaxy," explained Carollo. "Measuring both their motions and their chemical 
compositions allows us to separate them into these two halo families."
</p><p>
"Daniela, Tim, and the rest of their team have proven without a doubt that 
the Milky Way halo was not assembled all at once at early times," stated Yale 
University's Jason Tumlinson. "Astronomers have suspected for about 30 years 
that the outer parts of the Milky Way galaxy were assembled over time from many 
smaller protogalactic pieces. Now the SDSS-II team has shown that this is true 
even in the inner parts of the galaxy, and they've done it with a sample of 
stars large enough to banish all doubt."
</p><p>
Tumlinson, a galaxy formation theorist who was not part of the discovery 
team, said it was possible that stars from the "outer halo" are among the oldest 
parts of the Milky Way. "Speaking as a theorist who tries to build computer 
models of the construction of the Milky Way, I find this result inspiring in its 
statistical power, and yet frustrating at the same time as we are still 
struggling to build models with enough detail to adequately explain the observations."
</p><p>

What does it all mean? Chiba and the team believe that the inner halo formed 
first from the collision of smaller but massive galaxies that rotated with the 
Galaxy. The outer halo formed later from small galaxies orbiting the Milky 
Way in the reverse direction. These were torn apart by the Milky Way's 
gravitational forces, dispersing their stars into the halo. "We still have a lot to 
understand," admitted Chiba.
</p><p>
Beers and Norris have spent years searching for the most chemically primitive 
stars in the galaxy. Their heavy atoms may come from just a handful of early 
supernova, so their patterns of chemical elements provide "archeological" 
clues to the properties of stars that formed in the first billion years after the 
Big Bang.
</p><p>
These fossils of the early universe are extremely rare, Norris explained, so 
finding them remains a classic "needle-in-a-haystack problem." The 
identification of a chemically distinct outer halo "gives us a much better way to search 
the haystack."
</p><p>
More data are on the way. The Sloan Extension for Galactic
Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) is more than halfway to its goal of measuring motions and compositions for 250,000 stars. "With 10 times as many 
stars," noted Beers, "there are bound to be more surprises in store."

<p><b>About the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (www.sds.org)</b></p>

</p><p>
Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious survey of the sky ever 
undertaken, involving more than 300 astronomers and engineers at 25 institutions 
around the world. SDSS-II, which runs from 2005-2008, is comprised of three 
complementary projects. The Legacy Survey is completing the original SDSS map of 
half the northern sky, determining the positions, brightness, and colors of 
hundreds of millions of celestial objects and measuring distances to more than 
a million galaxies and quasars. SEGUE (Sloan Extension for Galactic 
Understanding and Exploration) is mapping the structure and stellar makeup of the Milky 
Way Galaxy. The Supernova Survey repeatedly scans a stripe along the celestial 
equator to discover and measure supernovae and other variable objects, 
probing the accelerating expansion of the cosmos. All three surveys are carried out 
with special purpose instruments on the 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point 
Observatory in New Mexico.
