A small section of the first-light image obtained by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey on the night of May 27-28, 1998.  The overall image is over
5,000 times larger than this small piece of the constellation Serpens.
The photo was assembled from digital scans taken through separate
filters.  (The individual colors provide valuable information for
identifying the objects.)  It also shows stars in our own galaxy (the
brighter ones are recognizable by the cross pattern), a half-dozen
distant galaxies near enough to show morphological features like disks
and rings, and many fainter and farther galaxies, distinguished from
stars by their slightly fuzzy appearance.
