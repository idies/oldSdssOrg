<h2>A new survey &mdash; SDSS-II will map the universe, the Milky Way and 
dark energy</h2>

<p>Dr. Richard Kron, director of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, announced 
a new undertaking that will complete the largest
survey of the universe. This survey will add new partners and
undertake new research missions, and will run through summer 2008.</p>

<p>Late last month the funding package for a new, three-year venture
called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) was completed, led by
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation of New York City, the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Department of Energy and the member
institutions.</p>

<p>The SDSS has been carrying out a massive survey of the sky using a
dedicated 2.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory near Sunspot,
New Mexico. SDSS-II will complete observations of a huge contiguous
region of the Northern skies and will study the structure and origins
of the Milky Way Galaxy and the nature of dark energy.</p>

<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious astronomical survey
project ever undertaken, already having measured precise brightnesses
and positions for hundreds of millions of galaxies, stars and quasars
during the last five years. The consortium of more than 300 scientists
and engineers at 23 institutions around the world &mdash; and hundreds of
other scientists working in collaboration &mdash; is using these data to
address fascinating and fundamental questions about the universe.</p>

<p>The exciting results from the SDSS data to date include the discovery
of distant quasars seen when the universe was just 900 million years
old; the definitive measurement of the large-scale distribution of
galaxies, confirming the role of gravity in growing structures in the
universe; and evidence that the Milky Way galaxy grew by cannibalizing
smaller companion galaxies.</p>

<p>"We are very excited with the funding agencies' decision to support
this important mission," said Kron of the University of Chicago. "The
dedicated scientists and engineers of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
have worked tirelessly to open new ways of seeing the Universe.</p>

<p>"We believe the SDSS-II discoveries that lie ahead will further
scientific discoveries and lay the groundwork for future astronomical
exploration. We are sure that the data released to the public will
yield discoveries for years to come."</p>

<p>In the last five years, the SDSS has released data for almost 200
million objects to the public. These data have been used by hundreds
of researchers around the world for scientific projects ranging from
studies of nearby stars to explorations of the nature of galaxies.</p>

<p>"We are proud of the landmark contributions made by the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey to our understanding of the evolution and structure of the
universe and enthusiastically support this next phase of research,"
said Doron Weber, program director of the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation. "The findings of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey have already
produced the most accurate picture of the skies that has ever existed
and we expect new discoveries that will continue to transform our
knowledge of the universe."</p>

<p>Eileen D. Friel, Executive Officer of the Division of Astronomical
Sciences at the National Science Foundation, said the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey "has enabled a remarkable array of scientific results,
sometimes in unexpected areas. The completion of the original survey
and its extension to address issues in galactic and stellar astronomy
promises to strengthen the legacy of the survey and to make it an even
more valuable resource for astronomers and educators."</p>

<p>And Robin Staffin, Associate Director of Science for High Energy
Physics in the Department of Energy's Office of Science, said the
agency was "delighted to see the Sloan Digital Sky Survey entering
this new phase. SDSS has already contributed a great deal to our
understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe, and has
helped pioneer the connections between particle physics and
cosmology. We expect that great science will come out of SDSS-II over
the next few years."</p>

<p>With the formation of SDSS-II, eight new institutions join the
collaboration: the American Museum of Natural History in New York City,
the University of Basel (Switzerland), Cambridge University (UK), Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, the Joint Institute for
Nuclear Astrophysics (University of Notre Dame, Michigan State
University, and the University of Chicago), the Kavli Institute for
Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford, Ohio State
University, and the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam (Germany). (A
complete list of SDSS-I and SDSS-II partners can be found below).</p>

<p>SDSS-II has three components. The first, called LEGACY, will complete
the SDSS survey of the extragalactic universe, obtaining images and
distances of nearly a million galaxies and quasars over a continuous
swath of sky in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The new funding also inaugurates the second part of SDSS-II, the Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE), mapping
the structure and stellar makeup of the Milky Way Galaxy, and
gathering data on how the Milky Way formed and evolved.</p>

<p>"The SEGUE project will allow us for the first time to get a 'big
picture' of the structure of our own Milky Way," explained consortium
member Heidi Newberg of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. "The mapping
of the Milky Way is more than an exercise in cartography. Ages,
chemical compositions, and space distribution of stars are major clues
to understanding how our own Galaxy formed, and, by example, how
galaxies, in general formed.</p>

<p>"Identifying the oldest stars will help us understand how the elements
of the periodic table were formed long ago inside of stars," Newberg
said.</p>

<p>The final piece of SDSS-II includes an intensive study of supernovae,
sweeping the sky to find these remnants of gigantic explosions from
dying stars.  Astronomers can precisely measure the distances of
distant supernovae, using them to map the rate of expansion of the
universe.</p>

<p>"This study will help to verify and quantify one of the most important
discoveries of modern science &mdash; the existence of the cosmological dark
energy," explained consortium member Andy Becker of the University of
Washington.</p>

<p>Becker explained that the SDSS telescope is uniquely positioned to
both discover, and follow up on, a wealth of supernovae at distances
at which other surveys have found very few objects. This allows a
direct measurement of the effects of dark energy on the geometry of
the universe as a whole.</p>
