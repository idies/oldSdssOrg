(JULY 19, 2003)  PITTSBURGH - Scientists from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey 
announced the discovery of independent physical evidence for the existence of 
dark energy.<br>
<br>
The researchers found an imprint of dark energy by correlating millions of 
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and cosmic microwave background 
temperature maps from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). The 
researchers found dark energy's "shadow" on the ancient cosmic radiation, a 
relic of cooled radiation from the Big Bang.<br>
<br>
With the combination of results from these two large sky surveys, this 
discovery provides physical evidence for the existence of dark energy; a result that 
complements earlier work on the acceleration of the universe as measured from 
distant supernovae. Observations from the Balloon Observations of Millimetric 
Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics (BOOMERANG) of Cosmic Microwave 
Background (CMB) were also part of the earlier findings.<br>
<br>
Dark energy, a major component of the universe and one of the greatest 
conundrums in science, is gravitationally repulsive rather than attractive. This 
causes the universe's expansion to accelerate, in contrast to the attraction of 
ordinary (and dark) matter, which would make it decelerate. <br>
<br>
"In a flat universe the effect we're observing only occurs if you have a 
universe with dark energy," explained lead researcher Dr. Ryan Scranton of the 
University of Pittsburgh's Physics and Astronomy department. "If the universe was 
just composed of matter and still flat, this effect wouldn't exist."<br>
<br>
"As photons from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) travel to us from 
380,000 years after the Big Bang, they can experience a number of physical 
processes, including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. This effect is an imprint or 
shadow of dark energy on microwaves. The effect also measures the changes in 
temperature of cosmic microwave background due to the effects of gravity on the 
energy of photons", added Scranton.<br>
<br>
The discovery is "a physical detection of dark energy, and highly 
complementary to other detections of dark energy" added Dr. Bob Nichol, an SDSS 
collaborator and associate professor of physics at Carnegie Mellon University in 
Pittsburgh. Nichol likened the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect to looking at a person 
standing in front of a sunny window: "You just see their outline and can 
recognize them from just this information. Likewise the signal we see has the right 
outline (or shadow) that we'd expect for dark energy," said Nichol. <br>
<br>
"In particular the color of the signal is the same as the color of the cosmic 
microwave background, proving it is cosmological in origin and not some 
annoying contamination," added Nichol.<br>
<br>
"This work provides physical confirmation that one needs dark energy to 
simultaneously explain both the CMB and SDSS data, independent of the supernovae 
work. Such cross-checks are vital in science," added Jim Gunn, Project Scientist 
of the SDSS and Professor of Astronomy at Princeton University.<br>
<br>
Dr. Andrew Connolly of the University of Pittsburgh explained that photons 
streaming from the cosmic microwave background pass through many concentrations 
of galaxies and dark matter. As they fall into a gravitational well they gain 
energy (just like a ball rolling down a hill). As they come out they lose 
energy (again like a ball rolling up a hill). Photographic images of the 
microwaves become more blue (i.e. more energetic) as they fall in toward these 
supercluster concentrations and then become more red (i.e. less energetic) as they 
climb away from them.<br>
<br>
"In a universe consisting mostly of normal matter one would expect that the 
net effect of the red and blue shifts would cancel.  However in recent years we 
are finding that most of the stuff in our universe is abnormal in that it is 
gravitationally repulsive rather than gravitationally attractive," explained 
Albert Stebbins, a scientist at the NASA/Fermilab Astrophysics Center Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory, an SDSS collaborating institution. "This 
abnormal stuff we call dark energy."<br>
<br>
SDSS collaborator Connolly said if the depth of the gravitational well 
decreases while the photon travels through it then the photon would exit with 
slightly more energy. "If this were true then we would expect to see that the cosmic 
microwave background temperature is slightly hotter in regions with more 
galaxies. This is exactly what we found."<br>
<br>
Stebbins added that the net energy change expected from a single 
concentration of mass is less than one part in a million and researchers had to look at a 
large number of galaxies before they could expect to see the effect. He said 
that the results confirm that dark energy exists in relatively small mass 
concentrations: only 100 million light years across where the previously observed 
effects dark energy were on a scale of 10 billion light years across. 
A unique aspect of the SDSS data is its ability to accurately measure the 
distances to all galaxies from photographic analysis of their photometric 
redshifts. "Therefore, we can watch the imprint of this effect on the CMB grow as a 
function of the age of the universe," Connolly said. "Eventually we might be 
able to determine the nature of the dark energy from measurements like these, 
though that is a bit in the future."<br>
<br>
"To make the conclusion that dark energy exists we only have to assume that 
the universe is not curved. After the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 
results came in (in February, 2003), that's a well-accepted assumption," Scranton 
explained. "This is extremely exciting. We didn't know if we could get a 
signal so we spent a lot of time testing the data against contamination from our 
galaxy or other sources. Having the results come out as strongly as they did was 
extremely satisfying."<br>
<br>
The discoveries were made in 3,400 square degrees of the sky surveyed by the 
SDSS.<br>
<br>
"This combination of space-based microwave and ground-based optical data gave 
us this new window into the properties of dark energy," said David Spergel, a 
Princeton University cosmologist and a member of the WMAP science team. "By 
combining WMAP and SDSS data, Scranton and his collaborators have shown that 
dark energy, whatever it is, is something that is not attracted by gravity even 
on the large scales probed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.<br>
<br>
"This is an important hint for physicists trying to understand the mysterious 
dark energy," Spergel added.<br>
<br>
In addition to principal investigators Scranton, Connolly, Nichol and 
Stebbins, Istavan Szapudi of the University of Hawaii contributed to the research. 
Others involved in the analysis include Niayesh Afshordi of Princeton 
University, Max Tegmark of the University of Pennsylvania and Daniel Eisenstein of the 
University of Arizona.<br>

ABOUT THE SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY (SDSS)<br>
<br>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (sdss.org) will map in detail one-quarter of the 
entire sky, determining the positions and absolute brightness of 100 million 
celestial objects. It will also measure the distances to more than a million 
galaxies and quasars. The Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) operates 
Apache Point Observatory, site of the SDSS telescopes.<br>
<br>
SDSS is a joint project of The University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute 
for Advanced Study, the Japan Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins 
University, the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy 
(MPIA), the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State 
University, University of Pittsburgh, Princeton University, the United States 
Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.<br>
<br>
Funding for the project has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, 
the Participating Institutions, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the 
Japanese Monbukagakusho and the Max Planck Society. <br>
<br>
The WILKINSON MICROWAVE ANISOTROPY PROBE (WMAP) is a NASA mission built in 
partnership with Princeton University and the Goddard Space Flight Center to 
measure the temperature of the cosmic background radiation, the remnant heat from 
the Big Bang. The WMAP mission reveals conditions as they existed in the 
early universe by measuring the properties of the cosmic microwave background 
radiation over the full sky. (http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov)  <br>
