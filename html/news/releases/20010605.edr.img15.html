The Apache Point Observatory, from the South. The 2.5-meter telescope
that carries out the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is at the far
left. The white building just below center is a roll-off enclosure that
protects the telescope when it is not in use. The building with the
slant roof, just to the right of the enclosure, is where the fiber plug
plates are prepared for taking SDSS spectra. The small dome at center is
the Photometric Telescope, used to place the SDSS observations on an
absolute flux basis. The large, cubic structure at the rear is the
3.5-meter telescope, used, among other things, for following up
discoveries made with the 2.5-meter telescope.
