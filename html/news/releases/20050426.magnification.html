<h2>SDSS uses 200,000 quasars to confirm Einstein's prediction of cosmic
magnification</h2>

<p>Applying cutting edge computer science to a wealth
of new astronomical data, researchers from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) reported today the first robust detection of cosmic
magnification on large scales, a prediction of Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity applied to the distribution of galaxies, dark
matter, and distant quasars.

<p>These findings, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal,
detail the subtle distortions that light undergoes as it travels from
distant quasars through the web of dark matter and galaxies before
reaching observers here on Earth.

<p>The SDSS discovery ends a two decade-old disagreement between earlier
magnification measurements and other cosmological tests of the
relationship between galaxies, dark matter and the overall geometry of
the universe.

<p>"The distortion of the shapes of background galaxies due to
gravitational lensing was first observed over a decade ago, but no one
had been able to reliably detect the magnification part of the lensing
signal", explained lead researcher Ryan Scranton of the University of
Pittsburgh.

<p>As light makes its 10 billion year journey from a distant quasar, it
is deflected and focused by the gravitational pull of dark matter and
galaxies, an effect known as gravitational lensing. The SDSS
researchers definitively measured the slight brightening, or
"magnification" of quasars and connected the effect to the density of
galaxies and dark matter along the path of the quasar light.  The SDSS
team has detected this magnification in the brightness of 200,000
quasars.

<p>While gravitational lensing is a fundamental prediction of Einstein's
General Relativity, the SDSS collaboration's discovery adds a new
dimension.

<p>"Observing the magnification effect is an important confirmation of a
basic prediction of Einstein's theory," explained SDSS collaborator
Bob Nichol at the University of Portsmouth. "It also gives us a
crucial consistency check on the standard model developed to explain
the interplay of galaxies, galaxy clusters and dark matter."

<p>Astronomers have been trying to measure this aspect of gravitational
lensing for two decades. However, the magnification signal is a very
small effect &mdash; as small as a few percent increase in the light
coming from each quasar. Detecting such a small change required a very
large sample of quasars with precise measurements of their brightness.

<p>"While many groups have reported detections of cosmic magnification in
the past, their data sets were not large enough or precise enough to
allow a definitive measurement, and the results were difficult to
reconcile with standard cosmology," added Brice Menard, a researcher
at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ.

<p>The breakthrough came earlier this year using a precisely calibrated
sample of 13 million galaxies and 200,000 quasars from the SDSS
catalog. The fully digital data available from the SDSS solved many of
the technical problems that plagued earlier attempts to measure the
magnification.  However, the key to the new measurement was the
development of a new way to find quasars in the SDSS data.

<p>"We took cutting edge ideas from the world of computer science and
statistics and applied them to our data," explained Gordon Richards of
Princeton University.

<p>Richards explained that by using new statistical techniques, SDSS
scientists were able to extract a sample of quasars 10 times larger
than conventional methods, allowing for the extraordinary precision
required to find the magnification signal. "Our clear detection of
the lensing signal couldn't have been done without these techniques,"
Richards concluded.

<p>Recent observations of the large-scale distribution of galaxies, the
cosmic microwave background and distant supernovae have led
astronomers to develop a "standard model" of cosmology.  In this
model, visible galaxies represent only a small fraction of all the
mass of the universe, the remainder being made of dark matter.

<p>But to reconcile previous measurements of the cosmic magnification
signal with this model required making implausible assumptions about
how galaxies are distributed relative to the dominant dark
matter. This led some to conclude that the basic cosmological picture
was incorrect or at least inconsistent. However, the more precise SDSS
results indicate that previous data sets were likely not up to the
challenge of the measurement.

<p>"With the quality data from the SDSS and our much better method of
selecting quasars, we have put this problem to rest," Scranton
said. "Our measurement is in agreement with the rest of what the
universe is telling us and the nagging disagreement is resolved."

<p>"Now that we've demonstrated that we can make a reliable measurement
of cosmic magnification, the next step will be to use it as a tool to
study the interaction between galaxies, dark matter, and light in much
greater detail," said Andrew Connolly of the University of Pittsburgh.

The left panel shows a grid of points representing background quasars. The
right panel is the same grid after being "gravitationally lensed" by the
cluster of galaxies shown in the center of the panel (the magnitude of the
effect is exaggerated to make it apparent by eye). As predicted by
Einstein's theory of general relativity, the light from the background
images is bent and distorted as it passes by the gravitational potential
of the galaxies and dark matter in the cluster on its way to observers on
Earth. The images nearest the foreground cluster have a larger area than
their counterparts in the left panel, making them brighter. This effect is
known as cosmic magnification.
