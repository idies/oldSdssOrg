<h2>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey turns its eye on the galaxy</h2>

<p><b>A closer look at the Milky Way</b></p>

<P>WASHINGTON &mdash; An amazing array of new stellar findings were released 
today in a special session &quot;Galactic Astronomy and The Sloan Digital Sky
Survey.&quot;</P>

<P>The tilted, egg-shaped Milky Way stellar halo, an explosion in the number
of &quot;pristine&quot; ancient stars, variations in the age and
chemical make-up of open cluster stars, &quot;high velocity&quot; stars in the
Galactic halo, and the search for other rare and interesting objects
were part of the earliest findings from SEGUE, the Sloan Extension
for Galactic Understanding and Exploration.</P>

<P>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) presentation was made today
at the American Astronomical Association's winter meeting in
Washington, DC.  SEGUE is one of three observing programs that
collectively make up SDSS-II, an extension through mid-2008 and an
expansion of the original Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).</P>

<P>&quot;SEGUE will provide an extraordinarily rich data set for studying
the global structure and stellar population content of the Milky
Way,&quot; explained Connie Rockosi, an astronomer from the University
of California's Lick Observatory and a co-leader of the SEGUE
team.</P>

<P>SEGUE will extend the five-band imaging survey of the precursor
SDSS to cover an additional 3500 square degrees, reaching into the
plane of the Galactic disk. It will also obtain spectroscopy for
240,000 stars selected from the images.</P>

<P>&quot;The maps of the stellar distribution and measurements of
stellar motions and chemical abundances will collectively tell us an
enormous amount about the formation, evolution, and merger history of
the Milky Way,&quot; added Rockosi.</P>

<P>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious
astronomical survey project ever undertaken.  The survey will map
one-quarter of the entire sky, determining the positions and absolute
brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects. It will also
measure the distances to more than a million galaxies and quasars from
the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico.</P>

<p><b>A more complex stellar halo</b></p>

<P>In a presentation entitled "In Search of the Stellar Spheroid
from SDSS and SEGUE", Heidi Newberg of the Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, one of the initiators of the SEGUE project, discussed the
picture of the Milky Way's extended stellar halo that is emerging from
SDSS maps.</P>

<P>&quot;The stellar halo appears to be much more complex than the
smooth, symmetric system envisioned in early models of the Galaxy. We
find many lumps and streams of tidal debris, strong asymmetry, and
even a hint that the stellar halo is not centered on the center of the
Galactic disk.&quot; Tidal debris consists of stars that have been
torn from small galaxies by the tidal gravity of the Milky Way.</P>

<P>In another presentation &mdash; "High-latitude Structure in the Milky
Way Halo" &mdash; SEGUE co-leader Brian Yanny of the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) presented some of the survey's early
results on structure in the Galactic halo.  Drawing on photometric
distance estimates for millions of stars from precise multi-color
imaging, and velocity and chemical abundance measurements from
medium-resolution spectroscopy of many thousands of stars, SEGUE
reveals several intriguing coherent structures at distances ranging
from 5 kiloparesecs (kpc) to 50 kpc from the Sun. (One kiloparsec is
about 3000 light years.)</P>

<p><b>&quot;Pristine&quot; ancient stars</b></p>

<P>The nuclei of most hydrogen and helium atoms were forged in the hot
early universe, but heavier elements, which astronomers generally
refer to as &quot;metals,&quot; are made in the interiors of massive
stars, then expelled into the surrounding gas when the stars reach the
ends of their lives.</P>

<P>&quot;Low metallicity&quot; stars, with only the tiniest traces of
these heavier elements, are the relics of the earliest generations of
star formation in the galaxy, forming from gas that had been only
minimally polluted by their predecessors.</P>

<P>In his presentation on "Low Metallicity Stars in SDSS and
SEGUE", SDSS-II member Timothy Beers of Michigan State University
(part of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics) noted that
previous surveys for stars with low abundances of heavy metals, such
as iron, identified several thousand &quot;very metal poor&quot; (VMP)
stars, with metal abundance less than 1/100th of the Sun's. These
surveys found only a few hundred &quot;extremely metal poor&quot;
(EMP) stars below 1/1000th of the Sun's iron abundance. Only a handful
of the rare, &quot;ultra metal poor&quot; (UMP) stars below 1/10,000th
of the Sun's abundance have ever been found.</P>

<P>But SEGUE is poised to radically transform this situation.</P>

<P>&quot;Even though the first SDSS was primarily aimed at the observation
of galaxies,&quot; Beers explained, &quot;the spectra of tens of
thousands of calibration stars' revealed more than 2,000 stars with
metal abundances less than 1/100th of the Sun's. This is a prodigious
yield for a class of objects that was not even targeted.&quot;</P>

<P>Beers estimates that SEGUE will increase the numbers of VMPs to
more than 20,000, EMPs to several thousand, and UMPs to several
hundred; numbers greater than those found in all previous surveys
combined.
</P>

<P>Astronomers will analyze the chemical abundance patterns in these
stars to infer the properties of the first stars that formed in the
Galaxy and the nucleosynthetic processes that created the chemical
elements.</P>

<P>In addition, notes Beers, SEGUE has the opportunity to turn up
previously undiscovered classes of objects. &quot;By measuring the
spectra of huge numbers of stars, we maximize our chances of finding
the rare jewels.&quot;</P>

<p><b>'High velocity' stars</b></p>

<P>SEGUE scientist Sebastien Lepine of the American Museum of Natural
History focused on measurements of stellar motions, in his
presentation on "High Proper Motion Stars in SEGUE and the Local 
Kinematics of the Galactic Halo". Lepine explained how he could combine 
SDSS-II data
with photographic images of the night sky &mdash; taken up to 50 years ago
&mdash; to identify stars that have moved more than a second of arc, or
1/3600th of a degree, in the last half century. 
</P>

<P>By combining these measurements of &quot;proper motion&quot; across
the sky with SEGUE's spectroscopic measurements of line-of-sight
velocities, Lepine can build a picture of the 3-dimensional motions of
stars in the Galaxy.</P>

<P>&quot;We are particularly interested in a rare breed of stars that
move through the Solar neighborhood at unusually large speeds,&quot;
Lepine explained. &quot;These 'high velocity stars' are not part of
the disk of our Galaxy, but rather are members of the Galactic Halo,
which contains most of the oldest stars in our Galaxy.</P>

<P>&quot;By tracing the motions of a few thousand stars from the
Galactic Halo, we will search for 'streams' or 'currents' in the Halo,
which will shed light on the structure, origin, and formation of the
Galaxy.&quot;</P>

<p><b>The open cluster examination</b></p>

<P>In the "SEGUE Open Cluster Survey (SOCS)" presentation,
Fermilab scientist Douglas Tucker, explained how the SDSS-II 2.5m
telescope's imaging camera will scan numerous star clusters within the
Milky Way Galaxy.</P>

<P>Because all the stars in any individual star cluster formed at the
same time and from the same cloud of interstellar gas and dust, they
lie at essentially the same distance from the Earth and have similar
age and chemical composition.  This internal regularity, with mass
being the main variable that differs from star to star, makes clusters
especially valuable laboratories for studying the formation and
evolution of stars and the global evolution of the Galaxy.</P>

<P>There are currently about 1,600 open clusters known in the Milky
Way Galaxy, Tucker explained, but only about a third have well
determined ages and distances, and slightly more than 100 have
well-determined chemical compositions.  Open clusters lie in the
Galactic disk, and their typical ages range from 10 million to one
billion years.</P>

<P>&quot;SOCS will provide uniform, precise photometry and chemical
abundance measurements for a huge sample of open clusters,&quot; said
Tucker.  &quot;This will be a superb data set for studying stellar
evolution and the role of heavy elements in determining the structure
of stars.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The most exciting aspect of SEGUE,&quot; notes Newberg, &quot;is
the prospect of building a complete picture of our galaxy. This global
picture will allow us to probe the mechanisms by which the Milky Way
and its constituent stars were created and assembled.&quot;</P>
