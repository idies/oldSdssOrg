This graph shows part of the spectrum of the most distant quasar
currently known, with a redshift of 5.0.  One of the identifying
characteristics of quasars is the large Lyman-alpha emission peak, a
feature that would appear in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum if the
source were not redshifted.  For this particular quasar, the peak lies
in the near infrared just beyond the range of human vision -- a factor
of six increase in the wavelength.  Aside from this extreme redshift,
the spectrum otherwise is very similar to those of more nearby quasars.
