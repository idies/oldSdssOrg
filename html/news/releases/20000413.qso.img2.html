This graph shows part of the spectrum of the most distant quasar
currently known, with a redshift of 5.8.  The large peak is called the
Lyman-alpha emission peak, and is a distinguishing feature of quasar
spectra.  This spectral feature would normally appear in the
ultraviolet, with a wavelength of about 1200 Angstroms.  For this
quasar, the Lyman-alpha peak appears in the infrared near 8300
Angstroms, representing a nearly sevenfold increase in the wavelength
due to the expansion of the universe.
