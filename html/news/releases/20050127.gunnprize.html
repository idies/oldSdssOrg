<h2>Gunn honored by AAS and Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</h2>

<p>Within just two weeks, SDSS Project Scientist Dr. James E. Gunn of
Princeton University received two of the highest awards in astronomy
and science.</p>

<p>On January 27, Gunn was awarded the 2005 Crafoord Prize by the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences. Two weeks before, Gunn was named the
recipient of the 2005 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, the highest
honor of the American Astronomical Society. It is awarded for a
lifetime of eminence in astronomical research.</p>

<p>The Crafoord Prize, awarded jointly to Gunn, James Peebles of
Princeton and Martin Rees of Cambridge University, was "for
contributions towards understanding the large-scale structure of the
Universe."</p>

<p>Gunn's citation from the Royal Swedish Academy reads: "James Gunn
first made theoretical contributions to the field of galaxy formation,
the gaseous medium between galaxies and the presence of dark matter in
galaxies. Later, he has played a central role in several observational
projects, like the Hubble telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
which aims to chart the properties of one million galaxies."</p>

<p>Announced earlier in January, the American Astronomical Society cited
Gunn: "For contributions to observational, instrumental, and
theoretical astrophysics that have informed our understanding of the
universe and a large fraction of its contents, including Gunn-Peterson
absorption in quasar spectra, weak gravitational lensing, galactic and
stellar dynamics, pulsars and quasars, and the objects of study of
numerous spectrographs, cameras, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey."</p>

<p>"In the broadest terms, there are three main areas of astronomy
research: theory, observation, and instrumentation. Most researchers
specialize in one of these areas, and a few have made substantial
contributions to two. Gunn has had an outstanding scientific impact in
all three," explained Scott Tremaine, chair of the Department of
Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University.</p>

<p>Tremaine explained that Gunn started his career as a theoretical
astronomer, doing groundbreaking work in gravitational lensing as a
cosmological probe, the formation and evolution of galaxies and the
large-scale structure of the Universe, and the physical nature of
pulsars.</p>

<p>Gunn was a leader in the 1970's and 1980's in observational studies of
distant galaxies, galaxy clusters, and quasars.  He and his
collaborators' papers set the standard for studies of globular-cluster
dynamics for a decade or more.</p>

<p>He played a central role as Deputy Principal Investigator in the
design and construction of the Wide Field and Planetary Camera on the
Hubble Space Telescope. His groundbreaking use of CCD detectors was,
at the time, a bold innovation. He also designed a number of major
instruments for the Palomar 5-meter telescope and others. For his
groundbreaking work, the American Astronomical Society (www.aas.org)
bestowed on Gunn the first Joseph Weber Award for Astronomical
Instrumentation in 2002.</p>

<p>In 1985, Gunn had the original concept for the SDSS, a comprehensive
mapping and cataloging of stars, galaxies and quasars on a scale never
before attempted.</p>

<p>"This concept was both a scientific vision for what was important (and
what could be practically addressed), and a detailed technical plan
for how to get there," explained Richard Kron, SDSS Director and
professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>"More than anyone else, he was involved in all aspects of the early
definition and design phase, and later in its operations. Throughout
he has worked to enhance the quality of the data, and the long-term
legacy and scientific productivity of the SDSS will be a testament to
his work in this respect.  He has served as Project Scientist from the
beginning, providing exceptional leadership in defining the course of
the survey, and inspiring many who have worked on the project."</p>

<p>The many ground breaking discoveries that the SDSS has made include
the most distant quasars known, evidence that our Milky Way galaxy was
formed by cannibalism of neighboring galaxies, the coolest stars
known, and the most precise measurement of the clustering of galaxies.</p>

<p><b>About the Sloan Digital Sky Survey</b></p>

<p>Simply put, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious
astronomical survey project ever undertaken. The survey will map in
detail one-quarter of the entire sky, determining the positions and
absolute brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects. It
will also measure the distances to more than a million galaxies and
quasars. Apache Point Observatory, site of the SDSS telescopes, is
operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC).</p>

<p>Funding for the creation and distribution of the SDSS Archive has been
provided by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Participating
Institutions, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the
National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the
Japanese Monbukagakusho, and the Max Planck Society.</p>

<p>The SDSS is managed by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) for
the Participating Institutions.  The Participating Institutions are
the University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study,
the Japan Participation Group, Johns Hopkins University, the
Korean Scientist Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Max Planck 
Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), the Max Planck Institute
for Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State University, University of
Pittsburgh, University of Portsmouth, Princeton University, the United
States Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.</p>
