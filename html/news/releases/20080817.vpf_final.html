CHICAGO - The largest 3-dimensional maps of the universe show 
that galaxies lie in filamentary superclusters interlaced by vast zones 
of emptiness, cosmic voids tens of millions of light years across that 
contain few or no bright galaxies.  Researchers analyzing the two largest 
maps, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) and the Two-Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), have concluded that these voids are also
missing the "halos" of invisible dark matter that bright galaxies
reside in.
</p><p>

"Astronomers have wondered for a quarter-century whether these
voids were 'too big' or 'too empty' to be explained by gravity
alone," said University of Chicago researcher Jeremy Tinker,
who led the new study.  "Our analysis shows that the voids in
these surveys are exactly as big and as empty as predicted by
the `standard' theory of the universe."
</p><p>

Tinker presented his findings today at an international
symposium in Chicago, titled "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey:
Asteroids to Cosmology."  A paper detailing the analysis
will appear in the September 1 edition of The Astrophysical
Journal, with the title "Void Statistics in
Large Galaxy Redshift Surveys: Does Halo Occupation of Field
Galaxies Depend on Environment?"  
</p><p>

A central element of the standard cosmological theory, Tinker explained, 
is cold dark matter, which exerts gravity but does not emit light,
and which accounts for more than 80 percent of the mass in the universe.
Dark matter is smoothly distributed in the early universe, but
over time gravity pulls it into filaments and clumps and empties 
out the spaces between them.  Galaxies form when hydrogen and
helium gas falls into collapsed dark matter clumps, referred
to as "halos," where it can form luminous stars.
</p><p>

"We wanted to see whether something strange is happening
to the dark matter halos in the regions where we don't
see galaxies," said team member David Weinberg of
Ohio State University.  "Maybe the halos are there, but they
just don't manage to form stars.  Then the voids would look
emptier than they really are, because they don't have anything
our telescopes can see."
</p><p>

To address this question, the researchers first determined the
relation between galaxies and dark matter halos by matching the
galaxy clustering in dense regions -- the web of filamentary
superclusters that interweaves the network of empty bubbles
and tunnels.  With this relation in hand, they used some of 
the world's largest supercomputer simulations to predict the 
number and sizes of voids.</p><p>
</p><p>

Princeton University graduate student Charlie Conroy measured
the sizes of voids in the SDSS-II maps.  "When we used galaxies
brighter than the Milky Way to trace structure, the biggest empty 
voids we found were about 75 million light years across," said Conroy.
"And the predictions from the simulations were bang-on."
</p><p>

The sizes of voids are ultimately set, Conroy explained,
by the small variations in the primordial distribution of
dark matter, and by the amount of time that gravity has
had to grow these small variations into large structures.
While studies from the 1990s showed that gravity could
create large regions of low matter density, the new analysis
shows that these regions should be truly empty of bright
galaxies and the halos massive enough to host them, and 
that the theoretically predicted sizes agree precisely 
with observations.
</p><p>

The agreement between the cosmological simulations and the 
measurements holds separately for red and blue galaxies, said
Tinker.  "Red galaxies are made of old stars, while a lot of
the light in blue galaxies comes from young stars," he
explained.  "Halos of a given mass seem to form similar
galaxies, both in numbers of stars and in the ages of
those stars, regardless of where the halos live."
</p><p>

"Void galaxies are different from typical galaxies in more
crowded parts of the universe," said Drexel University astronomer 
Michael Vogeley, who did not participate in this study but has
led earlier investigations of voids in the SDSS and 2dFGRS.
"The void galaxies are fainter, bluer, and are forming more stars.
But these differences may arise because these vast rural 
stretches of the universe contain lower mass halos than
the cosmic cities and suburbs, where most galaxies form."
</p><p>

SDSS and SDSS-II have mapped the 3-dimensional distribution
of nearly one million galaxies, over about one-fifth of the sky.
The 2dFGRS map contains 250,000 galaxies over 10 percent of the
sky.  Because the voids are themselves so big, enormous
maps like these are required to obtain precise statistics
on their sizes and frequency.
</p><p>

The SDSS and 2dFGRS do not probe the very faintest galaxies.
However, a recent preprint by Tinker and Conroy shows that
the good agreement between cosmological simulations 
and the emptiness of voids extends to maps of nearby
cosmic structure traced by these "dwarf"
galaxies, whose dark matter halos are fifty times
less massive than the Milky Way's.
</p><p>

"My favorite theory of cosmic voids," said Weinberg, "is one 
that I read long ago in The Weekly World News: Everything in the voids
was destroyed by space aliens during a giant intergalactic
space war.  The real explanation seems to be much duller.
But more reassuring."</p><p>
