<h2>A new galaxy atlas &mdash; Sloan Digital Sky Survey findings comprise new
compendium of galaxy families</h2>

<p>SAN DIEGO &mdash; In a poster whimsically titled "A whole lot of nearby
galaxies," New York University astronomers David W. Hogg and Michael
Blanton presented a new atlas of galaxies today at the winter meeting of
the American Astronomical Society in San Diego.</p>

<p>The atlas shows about 4,000 galaxy images taken from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the most ambitious astronomical survey
project ever undertaken. With more than 200 researchers from 14
institutions around the world, the SDSS is mapping in
detail about one-quarter of the sky, determining the positions and
brightnesses of hundreds of millions of celestial objects. It will
also measure the distances to about a million galaxies and
quasars.</p>

<p>Combining computer-aided data analysis with manual, subjective
human visual classification, the new galaxy compendium is based on
ages, masses, and other physical properties. In time, this may become
the largest and most useful visual atlas of galaxies ever
produced.</p>

<p>The atlas uses quantitative physical parameters measured from the
galaxy images and spectra, and presents the images for easy visual
classification of the galaxies into spirals and ellipticals.  This
two-pronged approach allows researchers to understand the relationship
between the two classification methods.</p>

<p>"Some properties of galaxies are straightforward to measure with
computer analysis of the SDSS data," explains Blanton, "while others
can only be reliably determined by human inspection. We are trying to
understand the relationships between these two different kinds of
properties."</p>

<p>This visual inspection for the purposes of galaxy classification
started with Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and led to an understanding
that galaxies fall into two broad types, spirals and
ellipticals. Within these there are physically important
subclasses.</p>

<p>The spirals, including the Milky Way, have young stars arranged in
a large, thin, rotating disk with the stars, gas and dust arranged in
spiral patterns. The ellipticals have older stars arranged in a dense,
spheroidal blob.</p>

<p>Both kinds of galaxies are clearly visible in Hogg and Blanton's
atlas, with the spirals tending to be bluer, less dense, and in
regions of space with relatively few companion galaxies. The
ellipticals tend to be redder, more dense and surrounded by many other
galaxies.</p>

<p>Hogg and Blanton originally made the charts &mdash; dense grids of small
color pictures of galaxies &mdash; as a research and data visualization tool
for quality-checking the SDSS data set, but quickly found that the
charts were interesting and beautiful, and yielded real insight into
galaxy properties, making them appropriate for presentation to the
whole scientific community.  The color pictures &mdash; using a technique
pioneered by SDSS astronomer Robert Lupton &mdash; convey far more
information than the traditional rendering of astronomical
images. This color rendering technique, combined with the very high
quality of the SDSS images, make this galaxy atlas more scientifically
powerful, and much more beautiful, than its predecessors.</p>

<p>Hogg explains that: "We spend a lot of time searching data for
patterns that might lead to new directions for research.  We have
generally found that when we make a useful and informative
presentation of the data for these investigations, that presentation
is also beautiful and scientifically compelling on its own."</p>
