This is a redshift histogram of the number of quasars that have been
reported in scientific journals (with the exception of the three new
high-redshift quasars discussed in this press release).  A black dot
indicates an object discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
The SDSS has found the six most distant quasars (and the four most distant
objects), as well as 26 of the 30 most distant quasars.
