Spectra of the three new high-redshift quasars taken this spring with
the 3.5-m telescope at Apache Point Observatory by a team led by
Dr. Xiaohui Fan of the Institute for Advanced Study.  The strong
emission feature is the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen, which normally
occurs at a wavelength of 1216 Angstroms but has shifted to the red by
approximately a factor of seven for these three objects.
