<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) announced today discoveries of 
two new faint companion galaxies to the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The first was found in the direction of the constellation Canes 
Venatici (the Hunting Dog) by SDSS-II researcher Daniel Zucker at 
Cambridge University (UK). His colleague Vasily Belokurov discovered the 
second in the constellation Bootes (the Herdsman).</p>

<p>"I was poring over the survey's map of distant stars in the Northern 
Galactic sky &mdash; what we call a Field of Streams &mdash; and noticed an 
overdensity in Canes Venatici," Zucker explained. "Looking further, it 
proved to be a previously unknown dwarf galaxy. Its about 640,000 light 
years (200 kiloparsecs) from the Sun. This makes it one of the most 
remote of the Milky Way's companion galaxies."</p>

<p>Zucker emailed Belokurov with the news, and, just as discoveries often 
build upon one another, Belokurov excitedly emailed back a few hours 
later with the discovery of a new, even fainter dwarf galaxy. The new 
galaxy in Bootes, which Belokurov called Boo, shows a distorted structure 
that suggests it is being disrupted by the Milky Way's gravitational 
tides. "Something really bashed Boo about," said Belokurov.</p>

<p>Although the dwarf galaxies are in our own cosmic backyard, they are 
hard to discover because they are so dim. In fact, the new galaxy in 
Bootes is the faintest galaxy so far discovered, with a total luminosity 
of only about 10,000 Suns. But because of its distance (190,000 light 
years) it appears almost invisible to most telescopes. The previous 
dimness record holder was discovered last year in Ursa Major using 
SDSS-II data.</p>

<p>New galactic neighbors are exciting in their own right, but the stakes 
in searches for ultra-faint dwarfs are especially high because of a 
long-standing conflict between theory and observations. The leading 
theory of galaxy formation predicts that hundreds of clumps of "cold dark 
matter" should be orbiting the Milky Way, each one massive enough in 
principle to host a visible dwarf galaxy.  But only about ten dwarf 
companions have been found to date.</p>

<p>One possibility is that the galaxies in the smaller dark matter clumps 
are too faint to have appeared in previous searches, but might be 
detectable in deep surveys like SDSS-II.</p>

<p>"It's like panning for gold. Our view of the sky is enormous, and 
we're looking for very small clumps of stars," explained Cambridge 
University astronomer Wyn Evans, a member of the SDSS-II research team.</p>

<p>Added collaborator Mark Wilkinson: "Finding and studying these small 
galaxies is really important. From their structure and their motions, we 
can learn about the properties of dark matter, as well as measure the 
mass and the gravity field of the Milky Way".</p>

<p>The new discoveries are part of the SEGUE project (Sloan Extension for 
Galactic Understanding and Exploration), one of the three component 
surveys of SDSS-II.  SEGUE will probe the structure and stellar make-up 
of the Milky Way Galaxy in unprecedented detail.</p>

<p>"I'm confident there are more dwarf galaxies out there and SEGUE will 
find them, said Heidi Newberg of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
co-chair of SEGUE.</p>
