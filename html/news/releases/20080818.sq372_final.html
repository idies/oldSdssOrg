CHICAGO --  A "minor planet" with the prosaic name 2006 SQ372
is just over two billion miles from Earth, a bit closer than 
the planet Neptune.  But this lump of ice and rock is 
beginning the return leg of a 22,500-year journey that will
take it to a distance of 150 billion miles, nearly 1,600
times the distance from the Earth to the Sun, according to
a team of researchers from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).
</p><p>
The discovery of this remarkable object was reported today
in Chicago, at an international symposium titled
"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Asteroids to Cosmology."
A paper describing the discovery technique and the
properties of 2006 SQ372 is being prepared for submission 
to The Astrophysical Journal.
</p><p>
The orbital paths of the major planets are nearly circular,
but the orbit of 2006 SQ372 is an ellipse that is four times
longer than it is wide, said University of Washington
astronomer Andrew Becker, who led the discovery team.
The only known object with a comparable orbit is Sedna --
a distant, Pluto-like dwarf planet discovered in 2003 --
but 2006 SQ372's orbit takes it more than one-and-a-half
times further from the Sun, and its orbital period is 
nearly twice as long.
</p><p>
The new object is much smaller than Sedna, Becker said,
probably 30-60 miles across instead of nearly 1,000.
"It's basically a comet, but it never gets close enough
to the Sun to develop a long, bright tail of evaporated
gas and dust."
</p><p>
Becker's team found 2006 SQ372 by applying a specialized
computer searching algorithm to data taken for a completely
different purpose: finding supernova explosions billions of
light years away to measure the expansion of the universe.
The SDSS-II supernova survey scanned the same long stripe
of sky, an area 1,000 times larger than the full moon, every
clear night in the fall of 2005, 2006, and 2007.
</p><p>
"If you can find things that explode, you can also find 
things that move, but you need different tools to look 
for them," said team member Lynne Jones, also of the 
University of Washington.  The only objects close enough
to change position noticeably from one night to the next
are in our own solar system, Jones explained.
</p><p>
SQ372 was first discovered in a series of images taken 
between September 27 and October 21, 2006.
Team member Andrew Puckett, of the University of Alaska
Anchorage, then searched the supernova survey's Fall 2005
observations to find earlier detections, thus securing
the discovery.  Subsequent SDSS detections of SQ372 have
been found in data from the 2006 and 2007 observing seasons.
</p><p>
University of Washington graduate student Nathan Kaib, 
another member of the discovery team, has been running 
computer simulations to try to understand out how 
2006 SQ372 might have acquired its unusual orbit.
"It could have formed, like Pluto, in the belt of icy debris
beyond Neptune, then been kicked to large distance by a 
gravitational encounter with Neptune or Uranus," said Kaib.
"However, we think it is more probable that SQ372 comes 
from the inner edge of the Oort Cloud."
</p><p>
In 1950, Kaib explained, the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort
hypothesized that most comets come from a distant reservoir
of icy, asteroid-like bodies, which were ejected from the
inner solar system by gravitational kicks from the giant 
planets as the planets themselves were forming four and a half
billion years ago.  Most objects in the Oort cloud orbit
the Sun at distances of several trillion miles, but the 
gravity of passing stars can alter their orbits, flinging
some into interstellar space and deflecting others to the
inner solar system where they "light up" as comets.
</p><p>
Even at its most distant turning point, 2006 SQ372 will
be ten times closer to the Sun than the supposed main
body of the Oort Cloud, said Kaib.  "The existence of 
an 'inner' Oort cloud has been theoretically predicted
for many years, but SQ372 and perhaps Sedna are the first
objects we have found that seem to originate there.
It's exciting that we are beginning to verify these 
predictions."
</p><p>
Becker noted that 2006 SQ372 was bright enough to find with
the SDSS only because it is near its closest approach
to the Sun, and that the SDSS-II supernova survey
observed less than one percent of the sky.  "There are 
bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be
discovered by the next generation of surveys, which will
search to fainter levels and cover more area," said Becker.
"In a decade, we should know a lot more about this 
population than we do now."
</p><p>
"One of our goals," said Kaib, "is to understand the
origin of comets, which are among the most spectacular
celestial events.  But the deeper goal is to look back
into the early history of our solar system and piece
together what was happening when the planets formed."

<h3>About the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)</h3>

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious survey of the sky ever 
undertaken, involving more than 300 astronomers and engineers at 
25 institutions around the world.  SDSS-II, which began in 2005 and
finished observations in July, 2008, is comprised of three complementary 
projects.  The Legacy Survey completed the original SDSS map of 
half the northern sky, determining the positions, brightness, and 
colors of hundreds of millions of celestial objects and measuring 
distances to more than a million galaxies and quasars.  
SEGUE (Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding 
and Exploration) mapped the structure and stellar makeup of
the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Supernova Survey repeatedly scanned a 
stripe along the celestial equator to discover and measure supernovae
and other variable objects, probing the accelerating expansion of
the cosmos.  All three surveys were carried out with special purpose
instruments on the 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory,
in New Mexico.
