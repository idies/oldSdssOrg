This  illustration shows the distribution of dark matter, massive halos, and luminous  quasars in a simulation of the early universe, shown 1.6 billion years after the  Big Bang. Gray-colored filamentary structure shows the distribution of  "invisible" dark matter. Small white circles mark concentrated "halos" of dark  matter more massive than 3 trillion times the mass of the sun. Larger blue  circles mark the most massive halos, more than 7 trillion times of the sun,  which host the most luminous quasars. The strong clustering of the quasars in  the SDSS sample demonstrates that they reside in these rare, very massive  halos.
