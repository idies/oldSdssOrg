Early results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: From under our nose to
the edge of the universe
</h2>
<p>Pasadena, Calif. -- Scientists of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey today
(June 5) presented results based on early data from the project. The
first glimpses of what will ultimately be the most comprehensive and
fully digital map of the sky included identification of the two most
distant objects ever observed; new light on asteroids; and the first
SDSS results on the large-scale distribution of galaxies.</p>
<p>Sky Survey collaborators also announced the release to the worldwide
astronomy community of the first large piece of the digital sky.
<h3>Quasar Record-Breakers</h3>
<p>Dr. Donald Schneider of the Pennsylvania State University described
the observation of two quasars with respective redshifts of 6.0 and 6.2,
the most distant objects ever observed in the universe. The two new
quasars break the previous distance record established by <a
href="20000413.qso.html">last year's SDSS discovery</a> of a quasar at
redshift 5.8. The data presented today also reveal still another quasar
of redshift 5.8. The redshift of an object directly indicates the
relative size of the universe when the light was emitted: light from a
redshift 6.2 quasar left that object when the universe was 7.2 times
smaller than it is today.</p>
<p>"Quasars are precocious galaxies whose massive black holes began
accreting matter, lighting them up when the universe was less than 800
million years old," said Dr. Xiaohui Fan of the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, New Jersey, who led the team that identified the
quasars. "They allow us to study the birth of galaxies, and the first
supermassive black holes."</p>
<p>The SDSS's goal is the observation of 100,000 quasars. To date,
collaborators have discovered over 13,000, including the four most
distant objects yet seen, and 26 of the 30 most distant quasars. The
intervening material between us and a distant quasar absorbs some of the
quasar light and leaves its imprint in the quasar's spectrum that is
observed by the SDSS, explained Dr. Donald York of the University of
Chicago, the Sky Survey's founding director.</p>
<p>"In much the same way an x-ray reveals the inside of the human body,"
York said, "this spectrum reveals a line of sight across the universe,
sometimes passing through hundreds of galaxies.  With the SDSS spectrum
of a single quasar we can study hundreds of distant galaxies, some of
which are just forming."</p>
<p>The key to SDSS's success in quasar spotting is precision digital
data in five colors, allowing astronomers to distinguish quasars from
more common faint stars, explained Dr. Wei Zheng of the Johns Hopkins
University, who helped develop the color-tagging technique.</p>
<p>SDSS scientists follow up identified high-redshift quasar candidates
on larger telescopes to confirm their spectra. Astronomers took the
spectra of the two record-breakers with the Astrophysical Research
Consortium's 3.5 m telescope, located at the Apache Point Observatory in
New Mexico, also the site of the SDSS telescope.</p>
<p>"The discovery demonstrates the power of the 2.5 m special-purpose
SDSS telescope working in tandem with the larger 3.5 m general-purpose
telescope," York said. "It is exciting to see this partnership work just
the way we dreamed it would."</p>
<h3>Asteroids</h3>
<p>The SDSS collaborators presented the first clear evidence for
chemical segregation in the belt of asteroids between Mars and
Jupiter.</p>
<p>By viewing the asteroids in five color bands, explained Dr. Tom Quinn
of the University of Washington, the SDSS survey can reliably separate
individual asteroids into two main classes, rocky silicate asteroids and
more primitive carbonaceous asteroids.</p>
<p>"The SDSS observations also showed that the two types of asteroids
are spatially separated," Quinn said, "with the inner belt of rocky
asteroids centered at about 2.8 AU from the sun and the outer belt of
carbonaceous asteroids centered at about 3.2 AU. This distribution has
important implications for unraveling how the solar system formed and
suggests that planet migrations that seem to be common in other
planetary systems have not occurred in ours."</p>
<p>One astronomical unit, or AU, corresponds to the distance from the
sun to the earth.</p>
<p>The SDSS asteroid sample also turned up another surprise.</p>
<p>"There appear to be fewer asteroids smaller than about 4 km in
diameter in the asteroid belt than we previously thought,"  said
Dr. Zeljko Ivezic of Princeton University, the leader of the SDSS
asteroid team. "Since the asteroid belt is believed to be the reservoir
for Earth-crossing asteroids, the new SDSS observations suggest that
future asteroid collisions with Earth may be less likely than previously
believed."</p>
<p>The SDSS scanning technique allows only five minutes to follow
celestial objects as they move across the field of view, said Dr. Robert
Lupton of Princeton University.  During this time asteroids appear to
move a distance just 1/1000th the size of the moon, relative to the
distant stars.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," Lupton said, "we can reliably detect their tiny
motions and even determine their orbital motions around the sun."</p>
<p>The asteroid observations rely on precision position-finding software
developed by SDSS collaborators at the US Naval Observatory.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Galaxy Distribution</h3>
<p>The early SDSS results for distribution of matter in the universe
reinforce the current model of a low-density universe whose expansion is
accelerating, announced Dr. Alex Szalay of the Johns Hopkins
University.</p>
<p>"Our results fit with the distribution of matter inferred from
measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation," Szalay
said.</p>
<p>Dr. Josh Frieman of the University of Chicago and Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory said that SDSS observations together with recent
measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation have now
pinned down the distribution of matter from the relatively small scale
of galaxies all the way to the limits of the observable universe.</p>
<p>"Our observations are consistent with the idea that our universe
underwent a burst of enormous expansion when it was a fraction of a
second old," Frieman said.</p>
<p>The SDSS sample has also begun to answer longstanding questions about
the origins of galaxy types, the so-called "nature vs. nurture"
debate.</p>
<p>"Our data show that different kinds of galaxies cluster differently,
indicating that galaxies are influenced by their environment," said
Professor David Weinberg of the Ohio State University.</p>
<p>The quality of the SDSS digital data supersedes that of previous
surveys, which enables collaborators to make precise measurements of
large-scale structure even though they are using only a few percent of
the ultimate Survey data, explained Ryan Scranton, a graduate student at
the University of Chicago who played a key role in the analysis.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Data Distribution</h3>
<p>In a major milestone for astronomy, SDSS collaborators announced the
release to the worldwide astronomy community of the Survey's early
data. The release includes 500 square degrees of the sky, 500 Gigabytes
of images, precision measurements of some 14 million objects, and
spectra of 50,000 galaxies and 5,000 quasars. Ultimately, the SDSS plans
to release to astronomers and the public all the data from the five-year
Survey. This enormous data release--the biggest ever in astronomy--will
reside in archives at both Fermilab and the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, MD.</p>
<p>"I expect that the discoveries by astronomers outside the SDSS
collaboration, using the data archive, will ultimately dwarf those
produced by the collaboration itself," said Dr. Marc Postman, of the
Space Telescope Science Institute, who helped develop the archive
interface.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Stoughton of Fermilab explained that the software that
produced the data involved more than a million lines of code written by
the SDSS scientists.</p>
<p>"This early data release represents the work of dozens of
astronomers, computer scientists and programmers working over the last
decade," Stoughton said.</p>
<p>The key to accessing the data is the SkyServer, an interactive
interface developed with the help of Dr. Jim Gray of Microsoft's Bay
Area Research Center, said Hopkins' Szalay.</p>
<p>"With the SkyServer and the early Sloan data, any astronomer can
navigate the universe and access data for over 10 million objects," 
Szalay said.</p>
<p>A version of the SkyServer designed for students and the general
public is currently in development.</p>
<p>While the main science goal of the survey is a three-dimensional map
of the universe constructed from the positions of a million galaxies,
the SDSS will be the field guide to the heavens for decades, according
to Dr. John Peoples Jr., the project's director.</p>
<p>"When it is complete, the sky will be open to professional
astronomers, schoolchildren and the general public alike, day or night,
rain or shine," Peoples said.</p>

the Alfred E. Sloan Foundation, the participating institutions, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, The National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Japanese Monbukagakusho,
and the Max Planck Society. The SDSS is a joint project of The
University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the
Japan Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins University, the

Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State University, Princeton University,
the United States Naval Observatory and the University of
Washington.</p>
