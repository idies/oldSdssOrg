First Light: Mosaic

This is a mosaic of a region of the sky 2.5 degrees on a side.  Two
separate sweeps of the sky were made on successive nights with the
2.5-meter telescope and its mosaic camera.  The 6 columns of CCDs in the
camera collect data from 6 scanlines on the sky separated by small gaps.
By offseting the telescope a small amount between the two runs, the
scanlines from the two runs can be interleaved to form a seamless map of
a complete section of the sky.</p>
<p>
While this image may look small and unimpressive, consider that the
width of the <a href="19980608.fl.img1.html">previous first light
image</a> is about the same as the width of one of those 12 vertical
strips.
