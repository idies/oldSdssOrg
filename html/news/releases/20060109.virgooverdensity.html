<h2>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey reveals a new Milky Way neighbor</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A huge but very faint structure, containing 
hundreds of thousands
of stars spread over an area nearly 5,000 times the size of a full
moon, has been discovered and mapped by astronomers of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).</p>

<p>At an estimated distance of 30,000 light years (10 kiloparsecs)
from Earth, the structure lies well within the confines of the Milky
Way Galaxy.  However, it does not follow any of Milky Way's three main
components: a flattened disk of stars in which the sun resides, a
bulge of stars at the center of the Galaxy and an extended, roughly
spherical, stellar halo. Instead, the researchers believe that the
most likely interpretation of the new structure is a dwarf galaxy that
is merging into the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The new dwarf galaxy is found toward the constellation Virgo.</p>

<p>"Some of the stars in this Milky Way companion have been seen with
telescopes for centuries," explained Princeton University graduate
student Mario Juric, principal author of the findings describing what
may well be our closest galactic neighbor. "But because the galaxy is
so close, its stars are spread over a huge swath of the sky, and they
always used to be lost in the sea of more numerous Milky Way
stars. This galaxy is so big, we couldn't see it before."</p>

<p>The result was presented today in a session on the Milky Way at the
American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>The discovery was made possible by the unprecedented depth and
photometric accuracy of the SDSS, which to date has imaged roughly
one-quarter of the northern sky. "We used the SDSS data to measure
distances to 48 million stars and build a 3D map of the Milky Way," 
explained Zeljko Ivezic of the University of Washington, a co-author
of the study. Details of this "photometric parallax" method &mdash; using
the colors and apparent brightnesses of stars to infer their distances
&mdash; are explained in the paper "Milky Way Tomography" submitted to
the Astrophysical Journal. It is available in preprint form at
<a 
href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510520">astro-ph/0510520</a>.</p>

<p>"It's like looking at the Milky Way with a pair of 3D glasses,"
said Princeton University co-author Robert Lupton. "This structure
that used to be lost in the background suddenly snapped into view."
</p>

<p>The new result is reminiscent of the 1994 discovery of the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, by Rodrigo Ibata and collaborators from
Cambridge University. They used photographic images of the sky to
identify an excess of stars on the far side of the Milky Way, some
75,000 light years from Earth. The Sagittarius dwarf is slowly
dissolving, trailing streams of stars behind it as it orbits the Milky
Way and sinks into the Galactic disk.</p>

<p>In the last decade a new generation of sky surveys using large
digital cameras identified a number of streams and lumps of stars in
the outer Milky Way. Some of these lumps are probably new Milky Way
companions; others may be shreds of the Sagittarius dwarf or of other
dissolving dwarf galaxies. Earlier SDSS discoveries include an
apparent ring of stars encircling the Milky Way disk that may be the
remnant of another disrupted galaxy; and the Ursa Major dwarf, the
faintest known neighbor of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The first hints of an unusually high density of stars in the
direction of Virgo were made in 2001 by the QUEST survey, which used a
1-meter telescope in Venezuela to study a class of variable stars
called RR Lyrae variables.</p>

<p>"We found a clump of 5 RR Lyrae stars and speculated that they
belonged to a small galaxy being cannibalized by the Milky
Way," explained Kathy Vivas of the Centro de Investigaciones de
Astronomia in Venezuela, who (as a Yale graduate student) was the
author of the QUEST discovery paper. "In light of the new SDSS
results," Vivas added, "it appears that the stellar stream we detected
is itself part of the larger structure identified by Juric and
collaborators."</p>

<p>In the January 10, 2006 Astrophysical Journal Letter <a
href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0510589">astro-ph/0510589</a>, the
QUEST team led by Universidad de Chile graduate student Sonia Duffau
presented further evidence for this interpretation by measuring the
motions and chemical compositions of stars in the region.</p>

<p>"With so much irregular structure in the outer Galaxy, it looks as
though the Milky Way is still growing, by cannibalizing smaller
galaxies that fall into it," said Juric.</p>

<p>Another group of SDSS astronomers used the data to find the two
faintest-known companions of the Andromeda Galaxy, the closest giant
spiral galaxy similar in size to the Milky Way. Daniel Zucker of the
Max Planck Institute of Astronomy in Heidelberg and Cambridge
University's Institute of Astronomy led that team.</p>

<p>"These new Andromeda companions, alongside the new Milky Way
neighbors, suggest that faint satellite galaxies may be plentiful in
the Local Group," said Zucker.</p>

<p>While the SDSS was originally designed to study the distant
universe, its wide area, high precision maps of faint stars have made
it an invaluable tool for studying the Milky Way and its immediate
neighborhood. The 3D map created by Juric and his collaborators also
provides strong new constraints on the shape and extent of the Milky
Way's disk and stellar halo.</p>

<p>Another Princeton graduate student, Nick Bond, is using the subtle
motions of stars detected during the five-year span of the SDSS-I
observations to limit the amount of dark matter in the solar
neighborhood.</p>

<p>University of Washington graduate student Jillian Meyer is mapping
the distribution of interstellar dust, by carefully studying the
colors of stars found in both the SDSS and the infrared 2MASS
survey.</p>

<p>Building on these many successes, the SEGUE project (Sloan
Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration) will use the
SDSS-II telescope, its 120-megapixel digital camera and its 640-fiber
optical spectrograph to carry out detailed studies of the structure
and chemical evolution of the Milky Way.</p>

<p>SEGUE is one of three components of SDSS-II, the three-year
extension of the Sloan Survey continuing through mid-2008.</p>

<p>Fermilab scientist Brian Yanny, one of the SEGUE team leaders, is
excited at the prospect of examining its just completed, first season
of observations.</p>

<p>"The SDSS has already told us surprising things about the Milky
Way, but the most exciting discoveries should lie just ahead."</p>

<p>The figure above, by Mario Juric of Princeton University, shows 
the counts
of faint blue stars selected from a narrow magnitude and color range,
and corresponding to a distance from Earth of about 10 kpc. The map
shows the view from far away above the galactic plane.</p>

<p>According to the standard Milky Way models, the top and bottom
halves should be symmetric with respect to the horizontal line in the
middle, because the Milky Way is believed to be symmetric around its 
rotation axis that passes through the Galactic Center and is 
perpendicular to this map. 

<p>The discovery of the large overdensity of stars at the longitudes of
about 300 degrees and latitudes of about 60 degrees breaks the expected
symmetry and is at odds with the standard models.</p>

<p>The dashed line shows the position of the plane containing debris
from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy that is being cannibalized by the
Milky Way. While its proximity to the new structure suggests that
perhaps the two may be related, the known Sagittarius debris is
located about four times further away.</p>

<p>This map is based on upcoming SDSS-II Data Release 5, and is shown
in Lambert projection of galactic coordinates: radial rays are lines
of constant longitude, circles are lines of constant latitude, the
North Galactic Pole is in the center and the Galactic Center is
towards the left. The counts are shown on a logarithmic stretch, with
a dynamic range of 10 increasing from blue to red.
