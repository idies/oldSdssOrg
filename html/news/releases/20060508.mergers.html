The "Field of Streams" &mdash; this image is a map of stars in the outer 
regions of the Milky Way 
covering about one-quarter of the night sky, as observed by the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II). The trails and streams that cross the image 
are stars torn from disrupted Milky Way satellites. The color corresponds 
to distance, with red being the most distant and blue being the closest. 
The large, forked feature is the Sagittarius stream, further away from us 
(lower left) and closer to us (middle right). Other features marked are 
the Monoceros ring and the as yet unidentified stream.<br>(Credit: Vasily

<P>
A new map of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, constructed with data from 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II), reveals a night sky criss-crossed 
with streams of stars, left behind by satellite galaxies and star 
clusters spiraling to their deaths.
</P>

<p>Analyzing five years of data spanning nearly one-quarter of the sky, 
Cambridge University (UK) researchers Vasily Belokurov and Daniel Zucker 
created a dramatic new image of the outer Milky Way, using stellar colors 
eliminating the redder, nearby stars that would otherwise swamp the view 
of background structures. They found so many trails of stars in their 
high contrast image that they named the area the "Field of Streams."</p>

<p>Satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are literally ripped apart 
by the tidal forces of our galaxy. As these satellites sink in 
gravitational quicksand, their stars are torn from them in giant streams 
that trace their orbital paths &mdash; just like meteor streams lie along 
the paths of defunct comets in the Solar system.</p>

<p>Dominating the Field of Streams image is the enormous, arching stream 
of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The Sagittarius dwarf was discovered 
more than a decade ago and other researchers have previously mapped its 
long tidal stream in other regions of the sky.</p>

<P><b>Forked streams</b></P>

<p>But the new SDSS-II data had a remarkable surprise in store.</p>

<p>"The stream appears forked," said Belokurov. "We are seeing different 
wraps superimposed on the sky, as the stream goes around the galaxy two 
or three times."</p>

<p>Because of the multiple wraps, the observations provide strong new 
constraints on the dark matter halo of the Milky Way, according to Mike 
Fellhauer of Cambridge University. "The leading theories of dark matter 
predict that the Galaxy's halo should be flattened, like a rugby 
football.  But our simulations only match the forked Sagittarius stream 
if the inner halo is round, like a soccer ball."</p>

<p>In addition to the Sagittarius arches, the Field shows faint trails of 
stars torn from globular clusters, and other rings, trails, and lumps 
that appear to be the remains of disrupted dwarf galaxies.  "There are 
more streams here than in a river delta, commented Zucker.</p>

<p>Prominent among these is the Monoceros stream, discovered previously 
by SDSS-II scientists Heidi Jo Newberg of Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute and Brian Yanny of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. 
The multiple rings of stars are all that remain from a dwarf satellite 
that was absorbed by the Milky Way long ago.</p>

<p>Crossing the Field is an enigmatic, new stream of stars extending over 
70 degrees on the sky, whose original source remains unknown.</p>

<p>"Some of these 'murdered' galaxies have been named," explained SDSS-II 
team member Wyn Evans of Cambridge, "but this galactic corpse hasn't been 
identified yet. We're looking for it right now."</p>

<p>These new discoveries add weight to a picture in which galaxies like 
the Milky Way are built up from the merging and accretion of smaller 
galaxies.</p>

<p>"We've known about merging for some time" said Yanny, "but the Field 
of Streams gives us a striking demonstration of multiple merger events 
going on the Milky Way galaxy right now. This is happening all over the 
Universe, as big galaxies grow by tearing up smaller ones into streams."</p>

<p>These streams also provide new tests of the nature of dark matter
itself, according to theorist James Bullock of University of California at
Irvine; Bullock was not part of the SDSS team. "The fact that we can see a
Field of Streams like this suggests that dark matter particles are very
'cold', or slow moving. If the dark matter was made up of warm,' fast
moving particles, we wouldn't expect these thin streams to hang around
long enough for us to find them."</p>
