The arrow in this image points out the record-breaking redshift 5.0
quasar discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  That faint red dot
of light represents an object that is actually a hundred times as
luminous as a typical galaxy.  Sky Survey astronomers identified this
object as a possible high-redshift quasar on the basis of its
exceptionally red color compared to ordinary stars and galaxies.
Followup spectroscopy with the ARC 3.5-meter telescope confirmed that
this unassuming speck was indeed the most distant quasar known to date.
