This methane dwarf in the Virgo constellation was discovered by Sky
Survey astronomers Zlatan Tsvetanov, Wei Zheng, and David Golimowski of
the Johns Hopkins University.  The near-infrared filter of the SDSS
camera enables the astronomers to distinguish very cool objects (such as
this dwarf) from the millions of stars imaged by the camera, on the
basis of the objects' extremely red colors.
