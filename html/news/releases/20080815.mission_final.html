The earth is at the center, and each point represents
a galaxy, typically containing about 100 billion stars.
Galaxies are colored according to the ages of their stars,

galaxies that are made of older stars.  The outer circle 
is at a distance of two billion light years.  The region 
between the wedges was not mapped by the SDSS because dust in

CHICAGO -- After a decade of construction and eight years of operation 
(SDSS-I, 2000-2005; SDSS-II, 2005-2008), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) 
completed its observations in mid-July and will release its final data 
set to the public in October.  SDSS-III, a six-year program composed of 
four new surveys, has now begun, using the same telescope.
</p><p>
"I'm glad we didn't know at the beginning how hard
it would be and how long it would take," said SDSS Project 
Scientist Jim Gunn, the Princeton astronomer who has guided the 
project since its inception.  "But now that we've finally
accomplished what we set out to do, and much more besides, 
it seems worth all the effort and all the headaches along
the way."
</p><p>
Using a dedicated 2.5-meter diameter telescope equipped with 
two specialized instruments -- a 125-Megapixel digital camera and 
spectrographs that observe 640 stars and galaxies at a time -- 
SDSS has completed its original goals by making deep, 
multi-color images covering more than one-quarter of the sky 
and measuring the distances to nearly one million galaxies 
and over 100,000 quasars, thus creating the largest ever 
3-dimensional maps of cosmic structure.  
</p><p>
"What amazes me is the huge range of the discoveries that have 
come from SDSS data," said SDSS-II Director Richard Kron, an 
astronomer at the University of Chicago and Fermilab.  "We designed 
it primarily as a survey to map the distribution of galaxies and 
quasars, but it's also had a huge impact on the study of stars, 
the structure of our own Galaxy, and even solar system objects."
</p><p>
Those achievements are being celebrated this weekend at an 
international symposium titled "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey: 
Asteroids to Cosmology," hosted by the Kavli Institute for 
Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago.  In more than 
80 presentations, astronomers from around the globe will describe 
new discoveries about stars, galaxies, and the cosmos, from the 
SDSS and from some of the other ambitious surveys that it helped inspire.
</p><p>
Astronomers are using SDSS images and maps to understand 
the origins of galaxies and the properties of 
dark matter, the invisible material whose gravity binds stars
together in galaxies.  The gravity of dark matter also
arranges the galaxies themselves into filamentary strands
that span hundreds of millions of light years, forming
a network interleaved with low density tunnels and voids.

Observations of the most distant SDSS quasars probe the 
'epoch of reionization,' when radiation from the first 
galaxies burned through the fog of intergalactic neutral 
hydrogen and made the universe transparent to ultraviolet
light.  Quasars, the most luminous objects in the universe, 
are powered by hot gas falling onto supermassive black holes up
to ten billion times the mass of the sun.
Astronomers are combining SDSS data with measurements 
from space-based X-ray and infrared telescopes to trace 
the growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic history, 
to investigate the impact of the black holes on the galaxies 
in which they reside, and to discover the triggers that can 
cause a black hole to flare into brilliance after lying dormant for 
millions or billions of years.  
</p><p>
The biggest puzzle in cosmology today, according to University of 
Chicago and Fermilab researcher Joshua Frieman, is that the 
expansion of the universe is speeding up over time, despite 
the gravitational pull of all the normal matter and dark matter 
it contains.  "Either we don't understand the way gravity works 
on the scale of the whole universe," Frieman says, "or space is 
pervaded by some form of 'dark energy' that produces repulsive 
gravity." 
</p><p>
The nature of dark energy remains a mystery, and
SDSS researchers have been trying to pin down its properties 
by using the survey's giant imaging camera to repeatedly scan 
the same area of sky, discovering supernova explosions whose 
brightness can be used to trace the history of the universe's 
expansion with high precision.  By providing detailed measurements 
of objects as far away as four billion light years, the SDSS-II 
supernova survey perfectly complements surveys from larger telescopes 
that find fainter, more distant supernovae over smaller areas of sky, 
Frieman explained.
</p><p>
Closer to home, astronomers have used SDSS images to discover 
a dozen new galaxies that are satellite companions of the Milky Way,
most of them much fainter than any of the ten previously known satellites.
Star maps from SDSS images show that the outer reaches of the Milky Way
are criss-crossed with trails and streams of stars, probably 
the stretched-out remnants of other satellite galaxies that were 
torn apart long ago by the Galaxy's gravitational forces.
</p><p>
"Even the early SDSS images showed that the real Milky Way Galaxy 
is much more complicated than the one I learned about in graduate school," 
said Heidi Newberg of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  
Newberg initiated SEGUE (the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding 
and Exploration), one of three surveys that make up SDSS-II, 
which has imaged new areas of sky and has used the SDSS spectrographs 
to measure the motions and chemical compositions of 240,000 Milky Way stars. 
"SEGUE has already shown us that there are important clues to 
the history of the Galaxy and the properties of dark matter encoded
in the motions of Milky Way stars," said Newberg. "We expect to 
keep making important discoveries in the data for years to come."
</p><p>
SDSS-II observations ended on July 14.  On July 15, SDSS-III began.
"The ability of the SDSS facility to simultaneously measure spectra
of hundreds of objects over a wide area of sky remains a powerful
tool for astronomy," said SDSS-III Director Daniel 
Eisenstein, an astronomer at the University of Arizona.  
SDSS-III is a set of four ambitious new spectrosopic surveys,
addressing a wide range of scientific questions.
</p><p>
The biggest of the four surveys will use a novel technique 
to study the properties of dark energy.  "Sound waves that 
travel in the early universe imprint a characteristic scale 
on the distribution of galaxies, which was first detected by 
the SDSS," said Eisenstein.  "We can use this scale as a 
'standard ruler' to measure the expansion history of the 
universe, much as supernovae have been used as standard candles."
SDSS-III will map the clustering of the most luminous galaxies
over a volume seven times larger than SDSS-I and II,
Eisenstein explained, enabling it measure the length of 
this cosmic ruler with unprecedented precision.
</p><p>
Two other SDSS-III surveys will map the structure of the Milky Way, 
one in visible light, like SEGUE, and one in infrared light, 
which penetrates the interstellar dust that obscures our view of 
the inner Galaxy.  A fourth survey will monitor more than 10,000 
stars for the small 'wobble' caused by orbiting giant planets, 
providing the most comprehensive census to date of giant, 
Jupiter-like planets around other stars.
</p><p>
SDSS-III is funded by contributions from the 
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,  the U.S. National Science
Foundation and Department of Energy, and participating
institutions in the U.S., South America, Europe, and Asia.
"Throughout its life, the SDSS has been a remarkable
example of cooperation among public and private funding 
agencies and individual institutions around the world,
to enable science that would not otherwise be possible,"
said Richard Kron. In recognition of the pivotal and generous 
support of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation through all phases 
of the SDSS, the 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory
will be formally named The Sloan Foundation Telescope
at the Symposium.
</p><p>
More than any single discovery, Jim Gunn is proud of the quality 
and scope of the SDSS data sets.  "Visible light is where we 
understand the universe best, but when we began the SDSS, 
there were no sensitive, well characterized, visible-light 
catalogs that covered a large area of sky," he said. 
"Now we have multi-color images of 300 million celestial objects, 
3-dimensional maps and detailed properties of well over a 
million of them, and it's all publicly available online.
That changes everything."
