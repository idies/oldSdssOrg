The large bright galaxy, called NGC 6070, lies in the constellation of
Serpens.  It is receding from the Earth with a velocity of about 2000
kilometers per second and is at a distance of over 100 million light
years.  The blue light in the galaxy comes from recently formed hot
stars; the yellowish light comes from cooler, older stars.  Several
other galaxies are also visible.  The point-like images are stars in our
own Milky Way Galaxy.
