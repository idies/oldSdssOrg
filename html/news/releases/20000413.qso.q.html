How Can An Object We See Today be 27 Billion Light Years Away If the
Universe is only 14 Billion Years Old?
</h3>
<p>Because the Universe is expanding, light from distant galaxies is
shifted to the red (longer wavelengths).  The factor by which the
wavelengths of spectral features are increased is denoted as one plus
the redshift, <em>z</em>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>(received wavelength of light)</em> =
<em>(emitted wavelength)</em> x (1 + <em>z</em>).<br>
The phenomenon of redshift can be thought of as the stretching of the
wavelength of light by the expansion of the Universe.  This is
<em>not</em> the same thing as the Doppler shift caused by a moving
object, although cosmological redshift is often inaccurately described
in this way.  (The Doppler shift formula <em>z</em> =
<em>v</em>/<em>c</em>, or its relativistic counterpart, still applies in
astrophysical situations where the expansion of the Universe is not
important.)</p>
<p>The redshift of a distant object tells us directly the size of the
Universe when the light was emitted, relative to the size of the
Universe today.  So when the light was emitted from our redshift 5.82
quasar, the Universe was a factor of 6.82 (remember, 1+z) smaller in
linear size.  Quasar redshifts are very easy to determine.  You can
check our calculations yourself!  All quasars have a very prominent
feature in their spectrum, the famous Lyman alpha line of hydrogen; the
wavelength of Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms, in the ultraviolet.  For
our redshift 5.82 quasar this feature has been redshifted to around 8300
A, in the near infrared!</p>
<p>Computing the age of the Universe when the light was emitted from our
redshift 5.82 quasar is more challenging.  It requires knowledge of the
expansion rate of the Universe (Hubble constant) and composition of the
Universe (which determines the slowing or speeding up of the expansion).
Further, since the Universe is expanding, the quasar is farther away
now than when it emitted the light we see today, and so we must be
careful to qualify statements made about its distance.</p>
<p>Using our best values for the cosmological parameters (for the
experts H<sub>0</sub> = 65 &plusmn; 6 km/s/Mpc, Omega<sub>matter</sub> =
0.35 &plusmn; 0.07 and Omega<sub>total</sub> = 1.00 &plusmn; 0.05), we
can infer that the light we see today was emitted when the Universe was
about 0.95 billion years old; for these parameters the Universe is about
13.9 billion years old today.  (The error margin on this is -1.4 to +1.7
billion years.)  We are thus seeing the galaxy that hosts this quasar as
it was almost 13 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Estimating the distance to the quasar requires a little more work
yet.  According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, the
expansion of the Universe is actually an expansion of space itself, and
galaxies are moving away from each other because they are "being carried
along by space."  The theory does NOT limit the speed at which space
expands, only the motion through space.  Thus, the distance to this
quasar can be greater than 13 billion light years.  In fact, if we ask
the question, "How fast is the distance between us and this quasar
increasing?" we get the seemingly amazing answer of 540,000 km/sec or
about 1.8 times the velocity of light.  This number is ultimately not
very interesting, both because this is not the best way to think about
distant objects, and because there are objects farther away whose
distance is growing even faster.  To quote Fermilab's Judy Jackson,
"there is no speed limit on the Universe."</p>
<p>When we run the numbers, we find that this quasar is about 27 billion
light years away today.  This is the value we would obtain if we could
magically freeze the Universe in time and then measure the distance with
a meterstick.  From the redshift, we can then compute the distance to
this quasar when the light we see today was emitted: it is 27 billion
light years divided by 6.82, or about 4.0 billion light years.  These
numbers may seem paradoxical (and to be sure they depend somewhat upon
our knowledge of the cosmological parameters; the uncertainties are -2.8
to +3.6 billion light years), but they do make perfectly good sense
within Einstein's theory.  The theory is well tested and its predictions
make sense when carefully examined.</p>
<p>For example, although light from this distant quasar has only been
traveling for 13 billion years, the distance measured today between
where it began its journey to us and the position of the Milky Way is
(and must be) greater than 13 billion light years because of the general
expansion of the Universe.  In effect, the light has to fight its way
"upstream" against expanding space.</p>
<p>In the end, the key to understanding all of this is to view the
expansion of the Universe as Einstein's amazing theory tells us to, as
an expansion of space that scales up all distances in the Universe.  One
way to visualize this is to imagine a universe with just two space
dimensions, inhabited by two-dimensional creatures.  Their expanding
universe can be described as a rubber sheet that is being stretched
uniformly in both directions, thus increasing the amount of space.
Galaxies in this universe can be represented by dots painted on the
rubber sheet. The dots move away from one another not because they are
moving on the rubber sheet, but because of the expansion of the sheet
(in fact, it is simple to show that the change in separation of any two
dots with time is proportional to their separation; this is known as
Hubble's law).  Beyond the motion due to the expansion of the sheet,
galaxies and photons can move along the sheet.  The speed limit for this
motion is the speed of light.  However, there is no speed limit for
recessional motions associated with the stretching of the sheet.</p>
<p>Finally, we should clarify that an expanding Universe does not mean
that everything in the Universe is growing in size.  Objects held
together by forces strong enough to resist this expansion won't expand.
For example, atoms are held together by the electric force, neutrons and
protons are bound by the strong force, and astronomical objects like the
Earth, our solar system, and our galaxy are held together by the force
of gravity associated with these high concentrations of matter.</p>
