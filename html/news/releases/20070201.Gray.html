<h2>Search continues for SDSS contributor Jim Gray
</h2>


As many of you know, our colleague Jim Gray has been missing at sea
since Sunday evening.  
<p>
Dr. Gray was sailing near San Francisco in good weather. He is a highly experienced sailor, and the boat is well-instrumented.  So far no trace has been found, despite continuing, highly intensive searches. 
<p>
A blog has been established to track progress in the search. The address is <a href="http://openphi.net/tenacious/">http://openphi.net/tenacious/</a>.
<P>
Dr. Gray has had an enormous impact on our collaboration. Over the past five years, he has generously spent much of his time working with us to create
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  As we hope for his safe return, our thoughts are with him and his family.
