The halo of stars that envelops the Milky Way
galaxy is like a river delta criss-crossed by stellar streams large and 
small, according to new data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-II).
While the largest rivers of this delta have been mapped out over the
last decade, analysis of the new SDSS-II map shows that smaller 
streams can be found throughout the stellar halo, said Kevin Schlaufman,
a graduate student at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
</p><p>
Schlaufman reported his results today at an international symposium
in Chicago, titled "The Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Asteroids to 
Cosmology."  Over the last three years, Schlaufmann explained,
the SEGUE survey of SDSS-II has measured the motions of nearly a
quarter million stars in selected areas of the sky.
A careful search for groups of stars at the same velocity
turned up 14 distinct structures, 11 of them previously unknown.
</p><p>
"Even with SEGUE, we are still only mapping a small fraction of
the Galaxy," said Schlaufman, "so 14 streams in our data implies
a huge number when we extrapolate to the rest of the Milky Way."
If each velocity structure were a separate stream, Schlaufman
explained, there would be close to 1000 in the inner 75,000
light years of the Galaxy.  However, these structures could
arise from a smaller number of streams that are seen many
times in different places.
</p><p>
"A jumble of pasta," is the way Columbia University researcher
Kathryn Johnston described her theoretical models of the
Milky Way's stellar halo.  In a review talk at the symposium,
Johnston explained how dwarf galaxies that pass close to the 
Milky Way can be stretched by gravitational tides into
spaghetti-like strands, which wind around the Galaxy as stars
trace out the same orbital paths at different rates.
</p><p>
"In the center of the Galaxy, these stellar strands crowd 
together and you just see a smooth mix of stars," said Johnston.
"But as you look further away you can start to pick out 
individual strands, as well as features more akin to
pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more
elongated orbits.  By looking at faint features, 
Kevin may be finding some of the 'angel hair' that came
from smaller dwarfs, or ones that were destroyed longer ago."
</p><p>
Heidi Newberg of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and
her thesis student Nathan Cole have been trying to
follow some of the larger strands as they weave across the sky.
"It's a big challenge to piece things together," said Cole, 
"because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around
the Galaxy and pass through streams of stars ripped from 
other dwarf galaxies."
</p><p>
Toward the constellation Virgo, where SDSS images revealed
an excess of stars covering a huge area of sky, Newberg
finds that there are at least two superposed structures,
and possibly three or more.  The SEGUE velocity measurements
can separate systems that overlap in sky maps, Newberg
explained in her symposium talk.  "Part of what we see
toward Virgo is a tidal arm of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy,
whose main body lies on the opposite side of the Milky Way,
but we don't know the origin of the other structures.
There really aren't enough pasta varieties to describe
all the structures we find."
</p><p>
In addition to stellar streams, astronomers searching the
SDSS data have found 14 surviving dwarf companions of the
Milky Way, including two new discoveries announced today
at the symposium by Gerard Gilmore of Cambridge University.
These satellite galaxies are orbiting within the halo of
invisible dark matter whose gravity holds the Milky Way itself
together. Most of them are much fainter than the ten
satellites known prior to the SDSS.
</p><p>
Because even the SDSS can only detect these ultra-faint
dwarfs if they are relatively nearby, there could be several
hundred more of them further out in the Milky Way's dark halo,
according to independent analyses by graduate students
Sergey Koposov, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy
in Heidelberg, Germany, and Eric Tollerud, of the University
of California at Irvine.  "Even so," said Koposov, "we 
expect that the number of dark matter clumps is much larger
than that, so something must prevent the smaller clumps
from gathering gas and forming stars."
</p><p>
The SDSS dwarfs have far fewer stars than the previously
known satellites, noted Gilmore, but they have similar
spatial extents, and the stars within them move at similar
speeds.  "I think the internal dynamics of these tiny
galaxies may be hard to explain with our conventional
ideas about dark matter," said Gilmore.
</p><p>
"The SDSS has taught us a huge amount about the Milky Way
and its neighbors," said Johnston, who is pleased to see
some of the predictions of her models confirmed by the
new data.  "But we're still just beginning to map the
Galaxy in a comprehensive way, and there's a trove of
discoveries out there for the next generation of surveys,
including the two new Milky Way surveys that will be
carried out in SDSS-III."

<h3>About the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)</h3>

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious survey of the sky ever 
undertaken, involving more than 300 astronomers and engineers at 
25 institutions around the world.  SDSS-II, which began in 2005 and
finished observations in July, 2008, is comprised of three complementary 
projects.  The Legacy Survey completed the original SDSS map of 
half the northern sky, determining the positions, brightness, and 
colors of hundreds of millions of celestial objects and measuring 
distances to more than a million galaxies and quasars.  
SEGUE (Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding 
and Exploration) mapped the structure and stellar makeup of
the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Supernova Survey repeatedly scanned a 
stripe along the celestial equator to discover and measure supernovae
and other variable objects, probing the accelerating expansion of
the cosmos.  All three surveys were carried out with special purpose
instruments on the 2.5-meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory,
in New Mexico.
