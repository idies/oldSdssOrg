<h2>The cosmic yardstick &mdash; Sloan Digital Sky Survey astronomers measure
role of dark matter, dark energy and gravity in the distribution of
galaxies</h2>

<p>SAN DIEGO &mdash; In the largest galaxy survey ever, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) confirmed the role of gravity in growing structures in
the universe, using the result to precisely measure the geometry of the
universe.</p>

<p>The SDSS researchers from the University of Arizona, New York
University, the University of Portsmouth, the University of
Pittsburgh and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology detected
ripples in the galaxy distribution made by sound waves generated soon
after the Big Bang.</p>

<p>"These sound waves left their imprint in the Cosmic Microwave
Background, remnant radiation from the Big Bang seen when the universe
was 400,000 years old.  We are now seeing the corresponding cosmic
ripples in the SDSS galaxy maps. Seeing the same ripples in the early
universe and the relatively nearby galaxies is smoking-gun evidence
that the distribution of galaxies today grew via gravity," explains
lead investigator Daniel Eisenstein of the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>Eisenstein made the announcement today during a press conference at
the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society in San
Diego. The paper, "Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the
Large-Scale Correlation Function of SDSS Luminous Red Galaxies" was
submitted for publication to the Astrophysical Journal on December 31,
2004.</p>

<p><b>Ripples as yardsticks</b></p>

<p>The early Universe was smooth and homogeneous, quite a contrast
from the clumpy array of galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed
today. One of the major goals of cosmology is to understand how these
structures grew out of the initially smooth universe.</p>

<p>The galaxies we see today consist of ordinary matter, made up of
the atoms of our familiar world. However, astronomers have long known
that there is roughly five times more "dark matter" than ordinary or
"baryonic" matter.  Understanding how gravity causes the clumps that
will become galaxies and clusters of galaxies to grow as the universe
expands requires studying the interaction between ordinary and dark
matter.</p>

<p>"In the early Universe, the interaction between gravity and
pressure caused a region of space with more ordinary matter than
average to oscillate, sending out waves very much like the ripples in
a pond when you throw in a pebble," explains SDSS scientist and
co-author Bob Nichol, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Cosmology
& Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth, the most recent
institution to join the SDSS collaboration. "These ripples in the
matter grew for a million years until the universe cooled enough to
freeze them in place. What we now see in the SDSS galaxy data is the
imprint of these ripples billions of years later."</p>

<p>Or gravity's signature could be likened to a ringing bell's
resonance in time and space, adds Idit Zehavi of the University of
Arizona. "This last ring gets forever quieter and deeper in tone as
the Universe expands. It is now so faint as to be detectable only by
the most sensitive surveys," Zehavi explains. "The SDSS has measured
the tone of this last ring very accurately.</p>

<p>"Comparing the measured value with that predicted gives a yardstick
that enables us to determine the rate at which the universe expands,
which in turn depends on the amount of both dark matter and dark
energy," Zehavi explains. Dark energy is the still mysterious
substance driving the acceleration of the universe today.</p>

<p><b>Waves separated by 500 million light years</b></p>

<p>The sound waves propagated for the first million years of the
universe's history.  Their existence was first predicted in 1970 and
they were first seen in 1999 in fluctuations in the remnant light from
the hot glow of the Big Bang known as the cosmic microwave
background. It had long been suggested that these sound waves should
also be present in the distribution of galaxies, but the signal was
predicted to be subtle and difficult to discern.</p>

<p>To find the signal, the SDSS team mapped more than 46,000 very
luminous red galaxies over a volume of space roughly five billion
light years in diameter. They found a slight excess of galaxies with
separations of 500 million light years, exactly the predicted
signature of the sound waves.</p>

<p>"This is just the scale predicted for these ripples", explained
David Hogg of New York University, a member of the team. "The precise
determination of the distance between ripples allows us to set the
scale of the expansion of the universe, which in turn allows us to
constrain the properties of both dark matter and dark energy."</p>

<p>SDSS team member Kazuhiro Yahata of the University of Tokyo led a
complementary analysis of quasar clustering and credits the huge
volume of SDSS data that allows such findings.  While Yahata's
analysis did not directly detect the 500 million light year yardstick
in the quasar distribution, its results are fully consistent with the
presence of sound waves.</p>

<p>A similar analysis on a different dataset by the Two Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey has also detected the sound waves. "It is
impressive verification of the standard cosmological model that two
groups with independent data have both made significant detections of
the baryon induced features in large-scale galaxy clustering," said
Shaun Cole of the University of Durham, lead author of the Two
Degree Field study.</p>

<p>"The amazing thing about all these results is that they are in
perfect accord with the predictions of our standard cosmological
model, including both dark matter and dark energy," says
Eisenstein. "So while it all fits together, it still leaves us 'in the
dark' about the nature of these two mysterious components which
dominate the energy of the universe."</p>

<p>In the first million years after the Big Bang, sound waves are
driven into the cosmic gas (bottom right).  SDSS researchers have used
to map of galaxies to detect the remnants of these waves.  The

imprint is too subtle to see by eye.</p>
