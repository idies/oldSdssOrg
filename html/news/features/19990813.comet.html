SDSS Discovers its First Comet
</h2>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has found its first new comet, the
latest in a series of interesting treasures mined from the Survey's
test-year data.</p>

align="right" hspace="3" vspace="2" width="140" height="190">Julianne Dalcanton, an SDSS
astronomer from the University of Washington, was sifting through test
run data from March 20.  She was using a "fuzzy blob" search algorithm
to find faint galaxies for her research.  But in addition to many
fuzzy-looking galaxies, the algorithm also yielded an elongated fuzzy
blob with a bright splotch at one end.  In other words, Dalcanton had
found a comet in the SDSS data.  Along with SDSS astronomers Steve Kent
and Sadanori Okamura, Dalcanton reported the discovery to the <a
href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/cbat.html">Central Bureau for
Astronomical Telegrams</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that Dalcanton's sighting wasn't actually the first
detection of this particular heavenly body.  Near Earth Object (NEO)
surveys had observed the object several times, up to a year earlier.
Based on Dalcanton's report of the comet's position and motion, Gareth
Williams of the IAU Minor Planet Center located the object in the <a
href="http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/">LINEAR project</a> database, and
Gene Magnier of the University of Washington produced another
observation from the <a
href="http://asteroid.lowell.edu/asteroid/loneos/loneos_disc.html">LONEOS
survey</a>.  However, the NEO surveys had merely classified the object
as "apparently asteroidal," not as an actual comet.  Comet C/1999 F2 was
therefore officially named Comet Dalcanton, in recognition of her
correct identification.</p>
<p>The Sky Survey seems to be acquiring a reputation for finding unusual
and interesting objects during its ongoing test phase.  The SDSS is
first and foremost a survey of distant galaxies and quasars in an effort
to map the large-scale structure of the universe, and it has already
distinguished itself in this arena by finding some of <a
href="../releases/19981208.qso.html">the most distant quasars known</a>.
But in the process of surveying one-quarter of the sky, the 2.5-meter
SDSS telescope will also image millions of objects in our own Milky Way
galaxy.  Many of these objects, such as the recently discovered <a
href="../releases/19990531.dwarf.html">methane dwarfs</a>, are
interesting in their own right.</p>
<p>Comet Dalcanton is no exception to this trend of interesting finds.
It is one of only a few known comets that are thought to come from the
inner Oort Cloud, a collection of billions of cometary bodies around our
solar system that are thousands of times further from the sun than Earth
is.  Comet Dalcanton also didn't make it especially far into our solar
system, compared to comets that we can see with the unaided eye.  It
reached its perihelion (distance of closest approach to the sun) just
inside the orbit of Jupiter in August 1998, and is now on its way back
to the Oort Cloud.  It will travel further away than almost all other
known periodic comets.</p>
<p>Despite not having come very close to the sun, Comet Dalcanton has an
especially prominent tail.  Such comets beyond the inner solar system
often escape detection because they lack visible tails.  Comet tails
form as the icy outer layers of the comet are vaporized by the sun and
then blown in the direction away from the sun by radiation pressure and
the solar wind.  Each time a periodic comet comes back to perihelion,
the tail becomes weaker as less material is available to evaporate.  So,
on the basis of Comet Dalcanton's significant tail, astronomers suspect
this is the comet's first foray near the sun.</p>
<p>This won't be Comet Dalcanton's last visit to our part of the solar
system, according to the SDSS and NEO surveys' data.  But don't hold
your breath; the comet's round trip will take 186,000 years.</p>
