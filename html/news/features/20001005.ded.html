<p>The most ambitious astronomical survey ever undertaken.  The largest
three-dimensional reconstruction of the universe ever made.  A quarter
of the sky -- one hundred million celestial objects -- observed and
recorded as 15 terabytes of digital information.</p>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey will take a giant step in the science of
mapping the universe, to create a new and unparalleled picture of the
cosmos.  As patterns and structures emerge from the survey data, they
will illuminate the history and origins of the universe itself.

<h3>From the Solar System to the Edge of the Universe</h3>

<p>Although less than ten percent of the sky has been digitized, the
Survey has already produced stunning science.  The SDSS has discovered
eight of the 10 most distant quasars, including <a
href="../releases/20000413.qso.html">the most distant one</a>.  Light
left this quasar when the universe was <a
href="../releases/20000413.qso.q.html">less than a billion years old</a>
and was a factor of 6.8 times smaller.  The first slice of the 3-D map
of the universe from a sample of 15,000 galaxies extends out to three
billion light years.  The slice from a sample of 1200 quasars extends
nearly four times as far.  The quality of the digital images has enabled
SDSS scientists to use the tiny gravitational distortion of the images
of distant galaxies by nearby galaxies to map the extent of the dark
matter halos of galaxies, showing that they contain more than twice as
much mass as previously believed.  Early data also turned up <a
href="../features/19990813.comet.html">an unusual type of comet</a> and
<a href="../releases/19990531.dwarf.html">the first solitary brown
dwarf</a> ever found.</p>
<h3>Transforming Astronomy</h3>

<p>For hundreds of years astronomy has been done one object at a time,
using general-purpose telescopes.  The SDSS is a new concept -- a
specially designed "astronomical experiment" to digitize the brightest
100 million objects and to determine the distances to the million
brightest galaxies.  The silicon universe created by the SDSS will be
accessed by virtually every astronomer.  The SDSS sky will be open, day
and night, good weather or bad.  It will be the field guide to the
heavens for the next fifty years.  The new approach to astronomical
research pioneered by the SDSS has already inspired other astronomical
experiments.</p>
<h3>The People's Universe</h3>
<p>The expanse of sky between the visible stars was once the province of
astronomers alone.  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey will make available to
every schoolchild the vast expanse of universe once only accesible to a
handful of observers using ultrapowerful telescopes.  The Sky Survey
will use the power of the Internet to bring into everyone's view the
millions of objects beyond the visible stars of our own galaxy to the
farthest reaches of the universe.</p>
<h3><a href="../../members/index.html">Survey Sponsors</a></h3>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a joint project of The University of
Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the Japan
Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins University, the
Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy, New Mexico State University,
Princeton University, the United States Naval Observatory, and the
University of Washington.  Apache Point Observatory, site of the SDSS
telescopes, is operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC).
</p>
<p>Funding for the project has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the SDSS member institutions, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Department of Energy, Monbusho, and the Max Planck Society.</p>
<h3>The People Behind the Survey</h3>

<p>Dr. John Peoples of Fermilab is the director of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey.  Dr. Arthur Davidsen of The Johns Hopkins University is the
chairman of the SDSS Advisory Council, and Dr. Timothy Heckman, also of
Hopkins, is the chairman of the Astrophysical Research Consortium.
Dr. James Gunn of Princeton University serves as project scientist, and
Dr. Michael Turner of The University of Chicago is the SDSS
spokesperson.  Dr. Bruce Margon of the University of Washington was the
chairman of ARC when the SDSS was initiated, and Dr. Donald York of The
University of Chicago served as its founding director.</p>
