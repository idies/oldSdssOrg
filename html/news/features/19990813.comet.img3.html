This is a histogram of the distribution of apohelia (furthest distances
from the sun) for the majority of known comets.  The spike under 10 AU
represents short-period comets, which are much more easily observed
because they pass closer to the sun and earth.  The red arrow marks the
apohelion of Comet Dalcanton (in the inner Oort Cloud).  The comet will
not return for over 186,000 years.
