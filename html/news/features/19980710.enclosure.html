The SDSS Telescope's Unique Enclosure

Most people, when asked to describe a typical astronomical observatory,
would be quick to point out the dome.  This hemispherical design, an
example of which can be seen at right, has been used for well over a
century to protect large telescopes from the elements.  At night, the
dome cracks open and rotates to allow the telescope to peer at the
heavens.</p>
<p>But unlike most telescopes, the main survey telescope for the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey does not have a conventional dome enclosure.  It is
instead sheltered by a movable building (seen below).  During the day,
the telescope "sleeps" in a horizontal position inside the building.
The enclosure rolls away at twilight to expose the telescope to the
night sky.</p>

Why did the Sky Survey designers decide on such an unconventional
method for protecting the telescope?  One motivation was cost; dome
enclosures are quite expensive compared to a roll-away shed.
The primary reason for ditching the dome, however, was to improve image
quality.</p>
<p>It turns out that the traditional dome design often causes
degradation of the images, a phenomenon known as "dome seeing."  While
the dome successfully protects the telescope from being shaken by wind
gusts, it also tends to prevent the circulation of air inside the dome.
Walter Siegmund, project engineer for the SDSS, explains, "With too
little air flow, the air temperature becomes nonuniform and images are
blurred.  Something similar occurs when you look through the air above
an asphalt parking lot on a hot day."</p>
<p>The SDSS engineers carefully designed the roll-away enclosure to
avoid these seeing problems.  The enclosure is rolled downwind from the
telescope, and its doors are kept open during observing, so that it
barely disturbs the air flowing past the telescope.  The prevailing
winds from the White Sands basin, west of the observatory, constantly
refresh the air around the telescope and prevent temperature gradients
from forming.</p>

While the enclosure design solves the problem of too little air flow, it
creates a new difficulty: too <em>much</em> air flow that shakes the
telescope.  The solution is the wind baffle, that shiny metal box
surrounding the survey telescope.  The baffle is made of a semi-porous
material that cuts the air flow speed by about 90 percent on average,
but still allows enough circulation to prevent nonuniform air
temperature.  The baffle structure is mounted separately from the
telescope itself, so that wind gusts will shake the baffle but not the
telescope.  The baffle also effectively shields the telescope optics
from stray light.</p>
<p>The compact movable enclosure has much less visual impact than other
observatories' large domes.  In an era of increased environmental
awareness, this less obtrusive design is an important asset.  A few
people may be disappointed by the building's lack of grandeur, but this
seems a very small price to pay for the superior quality of the images
that the SDSS telescope is now beginning to produce.</p>
