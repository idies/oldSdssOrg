The Sky Survey Replaces its Monitor Telescope:
<br><em>Solutions to the MT Problem</em>
</h2>
<p>By 1997, the SDSS astronomers were actively looking to replace the
monitor telescope.  Building a brand-new telescope was not a serious
option, as the process would take more than a year.  The monitor
telescope operations schedule already had been seriously delayed by the
ongoing telescope problems.</p>
<p>This meant replacing the telescope with a similar (but functional)
already-constructed instrument.  The Sky Survey team searched from White
Sands to Hawaii for 0.6-meter replacement telescopes, and found many
available instruments that fit their scientific needs.  Unfortunately,
the off-axis telescope mounts were all too large for the MT dome,
which was built with a fork mount in mind.</p>
<p>One idea was to elevate the dome to make the building taller.
Another was to contruct a new roll-off enclosure similar to the <a
href="19980710.enclosure.html">2.5-meter telescope's structure</a>.  But
these solutions would have added about another $100,000 to the price tag
of replacement.</p>
<p>Reluctant to undertake costly building modifications, the SDSS team
reconsidered an early suggestion: replacing the monitor telescope with the
0.5-meter student research telescope on the roof of the astronomy
building at Johns Hopkins University.  The slightly smaller telescope's
fork mount would just barely fit inside the MT's dome.  The optics, with
some modification, would be good enough for the Sky Survey's purposes.
Best of all, the telescope already belonged to an SDSS member
institution, so the transfer was considerably less complicated.</p>
<p>In February 1998 it was official: the JHU telescope would be
transported to Apache Point Observatory.</p>
