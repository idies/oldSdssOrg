The Sky Survey Replaces its Monitor Telescope:
<br><em>Problems With the Telescope</em>
</h2>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey started having troubles with the monitor
telescope shortly after its delivery.  For example:
<ul>
<li>The encoders weren't wired properly, which means that the computer
control system couldn't keep track of the telescope's position.
<li>The telescope truss was constructed from aluminum, which expands and
contracts with temperature more than most other materials.  This made
the telescope focus difficult to control; sharp images were all but
unattainable.
<li>A weight imbalance as small as one pound on either side of the fork
mount would cause systematic slippage of the drive mechanism.  Because
the CCD cooling dewar boils off about a pound of liquid nitrogen every
two hours, slippage was inevitable.
<li>The telescope drive disks were made of soft aluminum instead of
steel.  These large disks were being driven by hard steel wheels that
can easily deform and damage the disks.
<li>There wasn't enough gear reduction between the drive motor and the
telescope.  As a result, the motor's (completely normal) small velocity
variations caused unacceptably large errors in telescope tracking.
</ul>
<p>In short, the telescope manufacturer did not deliver a functioning
instrument.  John Briggs from the Yerkes Observatory and Tim McKay from
the University of Michigan were called in to attempt to fix the
telescope.  Their years-long efforts seemed largely futile, however.
The telescope wasn't reliable for more than a few weeks at a time, and
its image quality was never as good as promised.</p>
<p>Despite all its flaws, the monitor telescope <strong>could</strong>
actually produce data good enough for the Sky Survey's purposes.  But
the instrument required full-time maintenance, and no one was willing to
bet that the telescope would remain fixable throughout the projected
five-year span of the survey.  (By contrast, most research telescopes
last for 50 years or more.)</p>
