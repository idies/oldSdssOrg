The history of the photometric telescope
</h2>
<p>Sloan Digital Sky Survey's two telescopes are designed to work
together as a team, although it is a partnership of unequals.  The
dominant team member is the 2.5-meter telescope, meticulously planned
and built by the SDSS collaboration.  This instrument, from its
innovative wind baffle to its huge mosaic camera, was born and bred for
its task of methodically surveying 100 million objects in the
heavens.</p>
<p>The second telescope, by comparison, is the junior
partner. Its less glamorous job is to automatically observe many
standard star fields each clear night during the survey in order to
calibrate the data from the main telescope.  By performing this
time-consuming yet crucial chore, the telescope gives its larger
companion the freedom to efficiently scan the skies without
interruption. The Sky Survey collaborators, desiring a moderately
priced, low-maintenance automated instrument, originally purchased a 0.6-meter monitor telescope for $200,000 from a company purporting to specialize in such
telescopes.</p>
<p>But while the 2.5-meter telescope successfully demonstrated its
surveying prowess, the monitor telescope was plagued with problems</a>. "Incorrect materials and poor design
doomed it from the beginning," said Alan Uomoto
of Johns Hopkins University. "The result was a telescope that did not
meet performance requirements and had a short projected lifetime."</p>

collaborators decided that the monitor telescope could jeopardize the survey's
goals.  After careful consideration of several alternatives, the SDSS team decided to replace the
entire monitor telescope with an existing 0.5-meter telescope from the roof of the
astronomy building at Johns Hopkins.  In August 1998, the faulty telescope was
disassembled (as seen at left), and its replacement was lowered into the
dome at Apache Point.</p>

smoothly.  With a proven track record at Johns Hopkins, however, the photometric telescope soon demonstrated itself a worthy partner to the 2.5-meter.</p>
