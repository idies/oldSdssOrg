<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is conducted under the auspices of the
Astrophysical Research Consortium, a consortium of academic institutions
organized in 1984 to build and operate astronomical facilities and
equipment.  Current ARC members are the 
<a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>, the
<a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu">Institute for Advanced Study</a>, 
<a href="http://www.pha.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>, 
<a href="http://charon.nmsu.edu">New Mexico State University</a>, 
<a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>, the
<a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>, and
<a href="http://www.sci.wsu.edu">Washington State University</a>. 
The ARC 3.5-meter telescope, ARC's original
project, was dedicated in May 1994.</p>
<p>ARC's organization allows members to choose whether or not to
participate in financial and scientific aspects of individual
projects.  Nonmember institutions can participate in ARC projects through
memoranda of understanding.  Additional members of ARC or of particular
projects may be added from time to time, as mutually agreed by the
current partners and the new institutions.</p>
