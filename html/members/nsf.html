<p><a href="http://www.nsf.gov">The National Science Foundation</a>, a
federal agency that supports fundamental research in all fields of
science and engineering, has funded the planning of the Sky Survey and
is also contributing $5 million over five years to help fund
construction of the telescope and instruments to be used in the survey.
NSF supports such projects that provide broad access to data for the
greater scientific community.</p>
