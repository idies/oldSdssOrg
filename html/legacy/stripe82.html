<h1>The Legacy Survey: Stripe 82</h1>
<p>
The DR7 <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro">Catalog Archive Server</a> contains 
the Stripe82 database, distinct from the DR7 and RUNS databases, 
containing all imaging from SDSS stripe 82 along the Celestial Equator
in the Southern Galactic Cap (<em>Stripe 82</em>).</p>
   
<p>Subsets of the 303 individual stripe 82 scans were made public in previous data 
releases, but with DR7, we now make available a coaddition of 47 South strip and 55 North strip scans into a pair of runs in which objects are detected and cataloged about 2 magnitudes deeper than in any individual Stripe 82 scan.
The Stripe82 database includes a total of 303 runs (plus 2 coadd runs), covering any
given piece of the  approx. 270 deg<sup>2</sup> area (-50 < RA < 59, -1.25 < DEC < 1.25) approximately 80 times.</p>


<p>All 303 runs covering Stripe 82 are part of the <em>Stripe 82 database</em>,
which can be queried to search for variability (and propermotion, with
a bit more effort).  Only about one-quarter of the Stripe 82 scans
were obtained in photometric conditions, the rest were taken under
variable clouds and often poorer than normal seeing. For those
runs which are non-photometric, an approximate calibration, using
the photometric frames as reference, is derived and available in the 
<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/stripe82">CAS Stripe82 Database</a>, for objects 
with RA > 310 or RA < 59 degrees.</p>
