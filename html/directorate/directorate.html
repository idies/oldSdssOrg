<h2><a name="arc"></a>The Astrophysical Research Consortium</h2>
<p>The Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) was created to provide
the faculty, staff, and students from the Participating Institutions
with access to modern astronomical equipment for their research
programs.  It owns and operates the Apache Point Observatory (APO) in
Sunspot, New Mexico.  The ARC managed facilities at APO consist of the
3.5-meter telescope and its instruments, and the telescopes and
instruments of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).</p>

<h3><a name="sac"></a>The Advisory Council</h3>
