<p> A sampling of stars from the imaging data (see
<a href="skycoverage.html">Sky Coverage</a>) is targeted for
spectroscopic observations. Candidates are assigned to a series of plates,
each of which targets 640 objects. Spectra are measured using a a pair
of double spectrographs that cover a wavelength range of
3800-9200&#197 with a resolution of &lambda/&Delta&lambda ~ 1800.
</p>
<p>
The distribution of SEGUE plates in RA and dec is shown below:

<div align="center"><i>
Blue circles indicate main Galactic structure survey: 
yellow circles are special targets such as open clusters.</i>
</p>
<div align="left">
<p>
Two plates are exposed in each of 200 directions on the sky 
(for a total of 400 plates): <ul>
<li>one <b>bright plate</b>, with an
exposure time of about 45 minutes, 
<li>and one <b>faint plate</b>, 
with an exposure time of about 1.5 hours. 
</ul>
The faint plate yields S/N ~ 10 for objects as faint as g ~ 20.3 and 
S/N > 50 for g ~ 18.0. 
 A list of available plates, with links to the observed spectra, is
available at <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/spectro/programs-26.html
">plate lists.</a> 
</p>
<p>Note that SEGUE obtains
its spectroscopic target positions from both the Legacy <a
href="../dr7/dr7photogal_big.gif">SDSS Imaging Footprint</a> and the lower latitude SEGUE Imaging.</p>
<p>The SEGUE  <a href="stellarpars.html">Stellar Stellar Parameter
Pipeline</a>
(SSPP) has been developed to
extract atmospheric parameters from the spectra.

Radial velocities (with errors ~ 5 - 25 km/s) and fundamental stellar
atmospheric parameters (T<sub>eff</sub>, surface gravity, and
metallicity) are determined for stars at distances from 2 to 150 
kpc from the Sun.  <a href="rare.html">Rare objects</a>, such as cool white dwarfs (with distances
< 100 pc) are also targeted.  A detailed description of the SSPP can be 
found in 
<a href="../documents/sspp0627.pdf"> Lee et al., 2007.</a></p>

<h2>Interstellar Medium (ISM)</h2>
</div>
<div align="left">
<p>
Observations of stars at relatively low latitude
 are key to revealing the structure, 
kinematics and composition of the Galactic disks. 
However, the interstellar medium &#150;
clouds of gas and dust that permeate the disks &#150 modifies the
starlight that reaches telescopes on Earth.  The ISM can block 
or change the observed color of light from stars, and the amount
of extinction and reddening
depends on how much dust lies between a particular star and the
observer.   
</p>
<p>
Modern dust maps are two-dimensional on the sky; a better understanding of the 
three-dimensional distribution of dust in the Galaxy is essential
in order to accurately correct for the effects of the ISM. 
SEGUE will be instrumental in helping to create such a three-dimensional map
of the ISM.
</p>
<p>SEGUE will combine its optical catalogs with the 
2MASS point source catalog in order to better determine the amount of 
reddening for the brighter stars observed by 
SEGUE and help resolve ambiguities in stellar identifications.
</p>

<h3> Determination of Extinction and Reddening</h3>
<p>
SDSS utilizes the
<a href="305772.pdf">SFD dust map</a>, derived from maps of the infrared emission from
dust across the sky, to predict the extinction in each of the five
SDSS <i>ugriz</i> colors. The resulting extinction maps are used to correct the
observed magnitudes of quasars and galaxies before spectroscopic
target selection.
</p>
<p> SEGUE scans provide an important check of the SFD map, which is crucial for
<ul>
<li> correcting observations of extragalactic objects for extinction
<li> measuring an important CMB "foreground"
<li> understanding and improving the assumed model of the dust mass, 
composition and distribution.
</ul>
</p>

<h3> Spatial Mapping of the Local ISM</h3>

<p>SEGUE will use M dwarf stars to probe the three-dimensional structure of the
local dust at distances ranging from 100 to 1000 pc (where the
bulk of the extinction is expected to occur). M dwarfs are numerous, 
have a well-defined color-absolute magnitude relation, and their  
<i>g - r </i> colors lie
in a narrow locus about <i>g - r</i> = 1.4.

The spatial variation
of M dwarf <i> g -r </i> colors observed by SEGUE will be transformed
in a map of cloud locations using techniques such as maximum entropy
reconstruction.
</p>

<h3>Red Emission from Dust</h3>
 
A diffuse red glow can be seen around the edges of dust clouds imaged by SDSS
(see e.g.
figure 13 in the <a href="../documents/Segue3.pdf">SEGUE 
2004 White Paper</a>).
This glow may be related to diffuse extended red emission (ERE),
a broad emission band centered near 7000 &#197 and attributed to 
photoluminescence from carbon nonparticles. SEGUE imaging over large
areas containing a wide range of dust densities and starlight illumination
may help to establish the origin of this diffuse glow and offer insights
into the size range and composition variations of dust paricles in the ISM.
