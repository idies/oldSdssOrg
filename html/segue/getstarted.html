<h1> Getting Started:<br>
Accessing the SEGUE spectra 
and associated imaging </h1>

<b>Important note about linking SEGUE imaging and spectra in the CAS</b>

<p>The SEGUE spectra count as <a
href="../dr7/products/spectra/special.html">special-plate</a> spectra in
the CAS and are <strong>not</strong> considered to be
&quot;scienceprimary&quot;. Therefore, they are <em>not</em> linked to the
photometry in the usual way, e.g., they do not appear in the object
browser's default view like galaxy, quasar and stellar spectra from
the legacy survey. With DR7, all SEGUE spectra and imaging are in the
<code>BESTDR7</code> database.
See the <a href="getstarted.html#ex4">SEGUE sample SQL
query for instructions on joining SEGUE imaging and
spectroscopy</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some walk-through examples of how to access the SEGUE spectra
and associated imaging for your research.

<h2><a name="ex1"> Example 1: Stellar Parameters of Globular Cluster stars
</a></h2> 

This example demonstrates how to check the parameters of some SEGUE spectra of 'known objects' 
against values found in the literature.   We will check the Radial Velocities,
Metalicities [Fe/H], and stellar surface gravities of some stars
in the Hercules Globular Cluster (M 13 = NGC6205) with their cataloged 
values in the <a href=http://www.physics.mcmaster.ca/~harris/mwgc.dat>W. Harris catalog</a>:


<pre>
	To select star around M13 we need to know the position of
	M13 on the sky, which is (alpha,delta) = (16 41 41.5 , +36 27 37)
	or (l,b) = (59.01,40.91).  
	We convert the H:M:S, D:M:S notation for (alpha,delta) (J2000)
	to decimal degrees for the database:
	(alpha,delta) = (16:41:41.5 , +36:27:37) = (250.42292,36.46028)

	Let's use the stellar parameters table in the DR7 database to
	select stars with spectra near (within 1 degree, globular
	clusters have diameter generally much smaller than 1 degree) of this 
	position on the sky.

	We recommend the <a href=http://cas.sdss.org/casjobs>CASJOBS</a> interface for SQL database searches 
        of the SDSS/SEGUE data.All who are interested may sign up for 
        a free account under CASJOBs. CASJOBS has the all the advantages 
        of the regular skyserver SQL <a href=http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/sql.asp>ASTRO</a> along with a 'batch processing' 
        system for submitting long (up to 8 hours, with up to 500MB worth of 
        output) and complex queries to the database server for later retrieval 
	and cross-reference (through the MyDB system of user databases
	with intermediate results).  The output of CASJOBS queries may
	be downloaded to your home machine in CSV (comma-separated-value)
	ASCII text file format for uploading to EXCEL or further manipulation
	and plotting by the software package of your choice.

	The CASJOBS interface has on its 'Query' page a 'Context' menu,
	which indicates the database you will be searching in.
	You should use the 'DR7' context. This, by default, searches
	the 'BESTDR7' database which contains the SDSS imaging tables
	and the SDSS and SEGUE spectroscopic catalog tables.
	There is additionally a database called 'SEGUEDR7' which contains
	imaging catalogs for areas of the SEGUE <a href=../dr7/seguephoto_big.gif>Footprint</a> not in the 
        regular SDSS survey <a href=../dr7/dr7photo_big.gif>Footprint</a>.

	If you wish to determine whether or not a specific coordinate
	is in either the SDSSDR7 or SEGUEDR7 footprint, you may feed a
	list of (RA,DEC) coordinates into the SDSS DAS <a href=http://das.sdss.org/www/html/post_coords.html>coordinate search</a> form,
	or follow the "alternatives" instructions on that page for long 
	lists of coordinates.

</pre>
	The names of the key tables you will be interested in searching
	for SEGUE catalog information are:

	<pre>
	Context  tablename (case insensitive) what
	-----------------------------
	DR7	sppParams   Radial Velocities, 
			    de-reddened PSF magnitudes and colors, 
			    '[Fe/H]' metalicity estimates,
			    log g surface gravity indictors (used to
					tell a Red Giant from a Red Dwarf)
			    effective temperature (correlated with color)
			    proper motion information on star,
			    stellar classification information

	DR7     Star	    Full photometric information for all point
			    sources in the SDSS Legacy and SEGUE footprints.
			    Includes ugriz PSF magnitudes,
			    reddening information,  (colors may be calculated)
			    RA,DEC position information

	DR7	SpecObjAll	Spectroscopic information for objects in
				SDSS+SEGUE.  Note that the subset table
				'SpecObj' doesn't contain SEGUE spectra,
				only 'main survey' SDSS spectra (mostly
				galaxies).  

	DR7    PlateX		Metadata information about plates (which
				contain 640 spectra each) in the  SDSS+SEGUE
				surveys.  The information here (specificially 
				the 'programname' field) can be used to 
				distinguish SDSS (galaxy+qso+star) plates 
				(programname like 'chunk%')
				from SEGUE (all star) plates
				(programname like 'seg%').
				

	DR7    PhotoObj        Full photometric object information for 
			       all primary and secondary
				sources 
				(including extended objects such as galaxies), 
				in the DR7 SDSS+SEGUE footprints, a superset of
				'star'.

	DR7    PhotoObjAll     Full photometric information for all sources
				(including duplicates) in the DR7 footprint.
				A superset of 'photoobj'.


	DR7    propermotions   Propermotion information for 205M stars.
				
	</pre>



	Let's return to the example of searching for SEGUE information about 
	stars in the globular cluster M13.
<pre>
	We'll select all stars within about 1 degree
	of the known center of the cluster at (ra,dec) [J2000] = 
		(250.42292, 36.46028).

	The RA coordinate has a cos(DEC) 'shrinkage' in it,
	so to get stars in a box 1 degree on a side, we wish
	to search +/- 0.5/cos(DEC) degrees away in RA, but
	the standard +/- 0.5 degrees away in DEC:

</pre>
	Thus cut and paste this query to the DR7 context of Casjobs 'query' 
	window:

<pre>

	select count(*) from sppParams where
	ra between 250.42292-cos(36.46*3.14159/180) 
		and 250.42292+cos(36.46*3.14159/180) 
	and dec between 36.46 -0.5 and 36.46 + 0.5

</pre>

	and hit the 'Quick' button.  In a few seconds it should return
	a number like '1044', the number of stars which meet these
	conditions.
	
	You may return all the known information, including the
	12 measures of [Fe/H] and the 9 measures of log g
	for these stars with a query like:

<pre>
	select * from sppParams where
        ra between 250.42292-cos(36.46*3.14159/180) 
                and 250.42292+cos(36.46*3.14159/180) 
        and dec between 36.46 -0.5 and 36.46 + 0.5
</pre>
<p>
	However, that table is a bit hard to parse.
	Instead, let's select specific columns we wish to return
	from the complete list of all columns in 
	the <a href=http://www.sdss.org/dr7/products/spectra/spectroparameters.html>sppParams</a> table.
</p>
<p>
	We'll also restrict to objects which have 'good quality' measurements
	of [Fe/H] (we pick the 'adopted' measure of [Fe/H] named: 'feha'),
	by requiring that the error (fehaerr) on the measure is greater
	than 0 but less than 0.7 dex.  We'll also restrict to objects with 
	errors (elodierverr) on their radial velocity (elodierv) of 20 km/s or less:
</p>
<pre>
	select plate,mjd,fiberid,brun,brerun,bcamcol,bfield,bobj,
	       elodierv,elodierverr,feha,fehaerr,fehan,logga,loggaerr,loggan,
	       targettype,sptypea,hammersptype,flag,g0,umg0,gmr0,
	       ra,dec,l,b,chiHK,chiGband,teffa,teffaerr from sppParams
	    where
		 ra between 250.42292-cos(36.46*3.14159/180)
                and 250.42292+cos(36.46*3.14159/180)
	        and dec between 36.46 -0.5 and 36.46 + 0.5
		and fehaerr between 0.01 and 0.7 
		and elodierverr between 0.01 and 20

</pre>

<p>	Instead of entering this as a 'Quick' query, hit the 'Submit'
	button instead.  Though the query only takes a few seconds
	to run, this will save the output of your query as a named
	table in your 'MyDB', for instance MyTable_21 (your exact table
	name will vary depending on your query history, and it
	may be manually named to whatever you like).

</p>
<p>
	After the query runs (hit 'History' repeatedly to check if it
	succeeded, you may also choose receive an email
	when the query is done), go to 'MyDB' and find your 'MyTable_21'.
	It should have about 779 rows and take up 500 Kbytes of space
	in your MyDB area.  

</p>
<p>Click on the table and select 'Download',
	then click on 'Go' to reformat your table as a 'CSV' file.
	Then go to 'Output' and click repeatedly until the reformatted table 
	is available for 'Download'.  Click 'Download' to put the table on
	your local box.  Now you may use a variety of tools (Excel spreadsheet,
	AWK, TCL) to manipulate and plot your data.
</p>
<p>
  The columns of your output file (based on what you 'select'ed above) 	are:
</p>
<pre>
	 0 plate
	 1 mjd
	 2 fiberid
	 3 brun
	 4 brerun
	 5 bcamcol
	 6 bfield
	 7 bobj
         8 elodierv
	 9 elodierverr
	 10 feha
	 11 fehaerr
	 12 fehan
	 13 logga
	 14 loggaerr
	 15 loggan
         16 targettype
	 17 sptypea
	 18 hammersptype
	 19 flag 
	 20 g0
	 21 umg0
	 22 gmr0
         23 ra
	 24 dec
	 25 l
	 26 b
	 27 chiHK
	 28 chiGband
	 29 teffa
	 30 teffaerr

</pre>
	
	Here are some plots you should be able to easily reproduce:

<pre>

	1. Plot of gmr0 on the X-axis (limits -1 to 2.0) vs. g0 on
		the Y-axis (limits 21 to 12).
	   This is a classical <a href=m13cmd.gif>Color Magnitude Diagram</a>

		You will notice that the 'top' of this diagram is not
		populated, i.e. the Red Giant Branch. Photometry of 
		these stars saturated the regular SDSS 2.5m imaging camera
		(stars brighter than about with g=14 do this).

		We have obtained limited amounts of spectra of such stars,
		however their magnitudes are not cataloged in all cases
		(see example #XXX, below).


	2.  Plot a histogram of rva, the radial velocity, with limits
		from about -500 to 500 km/s.  
		The catalog heliocentric RV of M13 is
			-245.6 km/s, does your plot look like <a href=m13rv.gif>this</a>.


	Based on the above plot number of of RVs, let's subselect only stars 
	near the RV peak of the cluster, say with RV between -300 and -200 km/s.  
	Then histogram the Metalicities (histogram fehr from -4 to 0) of these:

	3. Do you get something like <a href=m13feh.gif>this</a>?

	Let's look at the surface gravity now.  Subselect those stars with RV between
	-300 and -200 that have small errors on the surface gravity, i.e. 
	loggerr between 0 and 0.5.  Then make a faux Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
	for the cluster by plotting Teff (teffa) on the x axis from 10000 to 3000 (K) and
	log g (Luminosity indicator) on the y axis from 6 to 0.

	4. This color vs. surface gravity <a href=m13logg.gif>plot</a> for a cluster is one 
	step closer to a 'physical' Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (usually plotted as 
	Teff vs. Luminosity) as opposed 
	to an observed parameter (color vs. magnitude) diagram.

	We see from this plot that some red giant branch stars have appeared. These had
	non-SEGUE photometry and so their g, g-r values were 0 in the inital selection.
	We may be able to find some indication of their magnitudes by looking at other
	magnitude indicators available.

	There are also a few BHB stars apparent at the hot (high Teff) left edge of the
	diagram. Let's examine the individual spectra for these stars:
</pre>
<p>	In particular, let's look at examples of a <b>K-giant</b>, and an <b>F turnoff star</b>.
</p>
<p>
	To find them, even though we don't know the g-r, g for the brighter objects,
	let's select on T<sub>eff</sub>, log g.
</p>
	<h4>K-giant:</h4>

<pre>	select teffa between 5000 and 5200, log g between 1.8 and 2,
	RV between -300 and -200, [Fe/H] between -1.8 and -1.3,
	extract the plate,mjd,fiberid triplet.

	There are two objects selected:
	plate/mjd/fiberid = 2174/53521/167
	and
	plate/mjd/fiberid = 2255/53565/518

	Browse these spectra by going to the link for the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/spectro/programs-26.html#segue">DR7 plate list</a> 
	and (scrolling down to the globular cluster section of plates near 
	the bottom) click on the link for plate <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/spectro/plate-2147-53491-26.html">2174</a>, (mjd = 53521) then in 
	the menu on the left, click on the link for fiberid = 167.  Nice spectrum!

	Note the weak Mg triplet at 5100-5200A, indicating a low surface gravity
	of a giant star.

	Also note that the photometry for this star is a 'place-holder' (it's 
	bogus). The photo catalogs info for this object, with run =0 indicates a 
	manually selected target not deblended or saturated in this crowded field 
	by the photo software.  Other information on this well-known object 
	(an M13 giant branch star) may be found in the literature by using the 
	RA,DEC information presented.

	Also examine the bright red giant on plate <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/spectro/plate-2255-53565-26.html">2255</a>, fiberid= 518.
	The spectrum of this object is clearly a red giant, with very 
	weak Mg 5100-5200, however,the astrometry on this object is 
	special, it is a 'shifted' plate, used to obtain spectra of 
	very bright stars. Thus, don't trust the RA,DEC for this star, 
	for reference in the literature until we post an updated version.
	(plate 2255 is the only one of a very small number of segcluster plates
	with this issue in DR7 SEGUE plates).
</pre>

<h4>	F-turnoff:</h4>
<pre>

	select gmr0 between 0.2 and 0.3, log g between 1.8 and 2,
	RV between -300 and -200, [Fe/H] between -1.8 and -1.3,
	extract the plate,mjd,fiberid triplet. There are about 18,
	so sort by mag, take the brightest,
	which is:

	2185/53532/500 = plate/mjd/fiberid.
	Examine plate <a href="http://das.sdss.org/www/html/spectro/plate-2185-53532-26.html">2185</a>, fiberid = 500. 
	It's a blue thing, with narrow balmer lines, pretty typical (early?) F star.

	If you'd like to grab more than just the picture of a spectrum, 
	but are interested in examining the spectrum in more detail,
	you can fetch this object from the DAS, with a 'wget' style 
	command like so:

	wget http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/2185/1d/spSpec-53532-2185-500.fit

	(you may grab it in your browser and download it, an rsync 
	interface is available for bulk downloads).

	Note that the plate number is padded with leading 0's to 
	four places and the fiberid to three places, thus 371/52078/1 
	would be: 

	wget http://das.sdss.org/spectro/1d_26/0371/1d/spSpec-52078-0371-001.fit


	Any available individual spectrum may be so obtained.


	This FITS file may be read into IRAF or any other imaging processing program.
	The data model for the contents of the spSpec files is given <a href=../dr7/dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html>here</a>.

	If you wish to retrieve all spectra for a given plate in one big FITS file,
	they are available from the DAS as spPlate* files.

	For plate 2185, this wget will retrieve the (typically 60MB) file:

	wget http://das.sdss.org/spectro/2d_26/2185/spPlate-2185-53532.fits

	The data model for spPlate files, in order that you may examine them
	with IRAF or another processing package is <a href=../dr7/dm/flatFiles/spPlate.html>here</a>.

	Any other plate may be retrieved the same way.

<h2><a name="ex4"> Example 4: Photometry connected to plate centers 
SDSS and SEGUE </a></h2>
<p>
	It is often desirable to select stars from an area of sky where
	not every star has a spectrum.  The ugriz photometry alone for
	a deep sample of stars is often enough to do significant Galactic
	Structure science.  In addition, it is often desirable to determine
	the 'selection function' of a set of spectra determined with some
	possibly not well known target selection algorithm.  For this 	
	reason one often wishes to select imaging from an area of sky
	where one has spectra, including objects for which no spectra
	exist in the same part of sky.
</p>
<p>
	All of the spectra reside in the CAS specobjall database,
	including both SDSS main survey footprint spectra and SEGUE
	spectra (along with assorted other spectra).
</p>
<p>
	Due to the difficulty in processing and interpreting highly
	reddened low-latitude, crowded stellar field imaging with the standard
	SDSS photo pipeline (which was designed for galaxy photometry in
	uncrowded fields), the SEGUE imaging for DR7 has been a special
	rerun number (648)
</p>
<p>
	In order to match a SEGUE spectrum with its full photometric 
	information (i.e. fields beyond that in the sppParams table, 
	which is often but not always enough), one simply
	joins the DR7 sppParams table with the specobjall table
	with the photoobjall table using 
	the bestobjid in the specobjall table to join to the
	objid in the photoobjall table, which the sppParams table
	and the specobjall table join on specobjid. 
</p>
<p>
	Thus, to match a SEGUE spectrum from the specobjall table
	with its corresponding photometric information,
	one should do this query:
</p>
<pre>

        select top 10 s.plate,s.mjd,s.fiberid,sp.psfmag_g,s.mag_1,
	spp.elodierv
	from specobjall s, photoobjall sp, sppParams spp where 
	s.specobjid = spp.specobjid and sp.objid = s.bestobjid
	and s.specclass in (1,6) and elodierverr > 0

</pre>

<p>	To query for imaging information around a given (ra,dec):
</p>
<pre>	
	To find objects in the plate 1880 field, centered at
	(RA,DEC) = (358.26,36.40) 
	one may perform one query as follows to select
	all stellar photometry:
</pre>
<pre>

	(done on the DR7 context of Casjobs):

	select run,rerun,camcol,field,obj,ra,dec,
		psfmag_u,psfmag_g,psfmag_r,psfmag_i,psfmag_z,extinction_u,
		extinction_g,extinction_r,extinction_i,extinction_z
           from star 
	    where ra between 358.26-1.5/cos(36.4*3.14159/180) and 358.26+1.5/cos(36.4*3.14159/180) 
		and dec between 36.40 -1.5 and 36.4 + 1.5
		and psfmag_g < 22
		


</pre>

	This query returns a large number (54,301) objects, and you may
	need to 
	'Submit' it rather than running it as a 'Quick' query (in casjobs).

	Once you download the output you may further subselect to
	only get objects within 1.49 degrees of (ra,dec) = (358.26,36.4)
	and you may with to add in cuts on color or magnitude,
	for instance, throw out objects fainter than 20.5, which
	is the faint limit of the spectrscopic sample.
	
	Then, if you are, for instance, examining spectroscopic completeness
	of the F subdwarf sample, you may further select objects with
	(g-r)_0 between 0.1 and 0.4 and compare the density of photometric
	objects as a function of magnitude with the spectroscopic sample
	of F stars on plates 1880 and 1881.

	In this fashion, one may obtain photometric information for	
	all SEGUE plates.  And dervive empirical selection functions
	based on the photometry with the same color cuts as the spectroscopy.

<h2><a name="ex5"> Example 5: Matching to Target photometry </a></h2>

<p>
This is best done in a two step process, where one first
'uploads' a set of id,ra,dec triplets for objects in question
into a MyDb, say mytable_14 in this example.
</p>
<p>
Then one connects to the TARGETDR7 context and matches 
the target photometry information to each id,ra,dec in the
list, using a position match.
</p>	
<pre>
SELECT myid, ra,dec, dbo.fGetNearestObjIdEqtype(ra,dec,1.2,6) as objId into #x
FROM mydb.mytable_14  

select n.myid,n.ra as inra,n.dec as indec,s.objid,s.run,s.rerun,s.camcol,s.field
,s.obj,s.ra,s.dec,s.psfmag_u,s.psfmag_g,s.psfmag_r,s.psfmag_i,s.psfmag_z ,s.type
from star s,
#x as N where s.objid = n.objid
