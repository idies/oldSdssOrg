Review of the White Paper on the

Sloan Extension for Galactic Underpinnings and Evolution (SEGUE)

The broad themes underlying SEGUE constitute a bold scientific vision
linking the unique potential of the Milky Way galaxy to illuminate the
formation and evolution of galaxies to forefront cosmology.  In a very real
sense, SEGUE could complete a quest begun by Carolyn and John Herschel two
centuries ago to map our galaxy. SEGUE's team of world experts have devised
a well-conceived plan to use the SDSS system to chart Galactic sub
structures at |b|>8 degrees.  This requires new observations within the
existing SDSS fields to be combined with new imaging and spectroscopic
surveys at lower Galactic latitudes.  Among the numerous important outcomes
expected from the plan are:
1. The first complete picture of the Sagittarius stream, whose discovery by
Ibata, et al. more than a decade ago presented the first direct evidence to
date of the Galaxy accreting another galaxy.  This process -- widely
postulated as fundamental to the formation of large galaxies -- can be
uniquely examined in detail by SEGUE.  Moreover, the proposed photometric
and spectroscopic work throughout the all-sky Sag stream promises to improve
significantly the SDSS calibration from which extragalactic science will
benefit greatly.

2. A census of the Galaxy for the existence of other major debris streams,
the number and properties of which will test current models of galaxy
formation and point the way to necessary modifications.  Only by looking
with a process such as that proposed by SEGUE will we know how many mergers
of this type actually occurred during the Milky Way's formation.

3. By combining information from higher through lower Galactic latitudes
with uniform longitude sampling SEGUE will quantitatively characterize the
poorly understood transition from Galactic halo to thick disk.
4. Building on SDSS' demonstrated ability, SEGUE will vastly increase the
number of the most extremely chemically deficient stars known in the 
Milky Way. The most extreme of these represent a 'Holy Grail' in the quest for
understanding the onset of chemical evolution in the Universe and the
buildup of the periodic chart of the elements.

Through the combination of accurate 5-band photometry (including Sloan's
powerful u filter), astrometry and spectroscopy, SEGUE can unravel Galactic
archaeology -- the star formation and chemical evolutionary history over
time scales from ten million to ten billion years.  By combination with the
U.S. Naval Observatory's astrometric surveys, SEGUE will determine full
three-dimensional stellar space motions that will unambiguously characterize
Galactic structure.  In our view it is not a stretch to claim that SEGUE
will revolutionize our understanding of Galactic structure and formation.
SEGUE discoveries will also create enormous synergy with other major
projects and facilities.


Moreover, SEGUE has the potential to:

1.     Provide observational constraints on the distribution of dark matter
in the Milky Way from the properties of the tidal debris streams.

2.     Take imaging data through the Galactic plane, and to provide selected
spectroscopy in the plane.  While image density in some regions will require
modifications to the SDSS standard procedures, many regions may be amenable
to the standard procedures.  The outcome will be insight into the
transitions between thick and thin disks.

3.     Target carefully selected open star clusters that can improve overall
SDSS calibrations, as well as provide insight into the properties of the
star clusters themselves.

4.     Provide a deeper sampling of the disk and halo component of the white
dwarf population in the Solar neighborhood that would provide a robust
constraint on the age and space density of both.


Another compelling characteristic of SEGUE is that it can be done
immediately because it relies on existing, well characterized equipment and
associated efficient data reduction pipelines.  In addition, the consortium
has a process in place that is releasing data to the international
astronomical community, thus enabling science far beyond the consortium
membership.
