<h1>SEGUE Imaging</h1>

<div align="left">
<p>

<p>The SEGUE imaging survey is designed to photometrically identify and trace 
all stellar components of the Milky Way Galaxy. 
The entire sky available from Apache Point 
Observatory will be sampled, with gaps of no more than 
about 10 degrees between observations at
high Galactic latitude (|b| > 30 degrees), and no more than 20 degrees at low 
Galactic latitude (|b| < 30 degrees).  This will ensure that 
all major structures, including the thin and thick disks, the stellar spheroid,
and substructures within the Galactic halo, are adequately sampled.
</p>
<p>The SEGUE <a href="skycoverage.html">sky coverage map </a> includes a detailed
description of the plate layout and  current observational status; the SEGUE
footprint in l and b, color-coded by level of  priority is shown below:

<h2>SEGUE Stripes</h2>
<p>
The SDSS telescope has a 3&#186 diameter field of view 
and imaging is obtained using a drift
scan camera with 30 2048 x 2048 CCDs at the focal plane, and five broad 
filters ,
<i>ugriz,</i> that cover a range from 3000 to 10,000&#197. Each continuous
scan constitutes an imaging <i>run</i> and generates a <i>strip</i>; two  
<i>strips</i> create a 2.5&#186 wide imaging <i>stripe.</i> 
(See <a href="../dr7/coverage/index.html"> 
SDSS DR7 Sky Coverage</a> for details.)
</p>

<p> A table of SEGUE stripes can be found at
<a href="stripetable.html"> SEGUE Stripes.</a>
</p>

<h2>Low Latitude Imaging</h2>
<p>Many of these stripes go to quite low Galactic latitude, and some
cross the Galactic plane. The photometric pipeline is not optimized
for the crowded fields found at low latitude, and so caution must be used
in these regions of high stellar density:
<ul>
<li> Outputs of the photometric pipeline appear to be good until
the density of objects exceeds ~ 4000 per 10' x 13' field (roughly
ten times the number density of objects at high latitudes).
<li> The point spread function (PSF) cannot be measured accurately in crowded
fields (the pipeline has difficulty finding suitable isolated stars).
This limits the accuracy of brightness measurements in these fields.
<li> The pipeline attempts to deblend objects with overlapping
images, but the deblend algorithm fails when the number of overlapping
objects in a single family is too large.  In such cases the number of detected
objects reported by the pipeline can be a dramatic underestimate.
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Photometric  Pipeline</h2>
<p>
SEGUE imaging data is processed using the SDSS photometric pipeline. 
Details can be found on the DR7
<a href="../dr7/algorithms/index.html">
algorithms</a> web page.
</p>
<h2>Proper motions</h2>
<p>Proper motions are 
estimated from comparison with USNO-B data, following the prescription of
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AJ....127.3034M">Munn et al. (AJ 127, 2004)</a>.
These proper motions are utilized in selecting candidates for
certain categories of the
SEGUE <a href="targetsel.html">target selection algorithm.</a>
