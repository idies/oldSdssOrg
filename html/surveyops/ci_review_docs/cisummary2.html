<P>In our zeal to find bugs in the telescope program, we neglected to mention
the many things that are being done right, such as the interlock system,
the TCC, the fact that you are implementing the TPM along with the necessary
tools, and the fact that the servos appear basically in good shape (electrical
noise notwithstanding).&nbsp; In addition, the talent that is represented
in the project is phenomenal.&nbsp; We feel that the project is fundamentally
sound, provided that the necessary concentrated manpower can be brought
to bear on the areas we have identified below.

<P>Our comments are purposely blunt.&nbsp; They are intended to be a road
map for what needs to be done to get the telescope operating efficiently.&nbsp;
They are not a review of the project's plusses and minuses, and as such,
may not be construed as an assessment of the overall project.<B><U><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></U></B>

<P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+1>Overall Issues</FONT></U></B>

<P>1. During commissioning of the system, the project needs a few capable
engineers dedicated to the task who spend most of their time on site. These
engineers, who would ideally be drawn from the existing staff, need equipment,
long periods of access, and technical support.

<P>2. A larger building is vital in order to allow efficient debug and
testing of the telescope.

<P>3. The project needs an on-site system engineer to prioritize and coordinate
the work necessary to bring the telescope to an operational state. In the
sense intended here, a systems engineer is a technical person.

<P>4. The project needs a project manager and a project management plan.

<P>5. The noise in the various sensors must be addressed immediately. In
particular, work on the servos is a much lower priority until the noise
in the axis encoders is eliminated.

<P>6. The variety of the computing hardware and software systems is of
concern. The project must plan for the case where a critical person is
not longer available. This plan should include instructions for rebuilding
executables. These instructions must be periodically exercised by the person
who is responsible at the time.

<P>7. It appears that the requirement for the speed of the azimuth axis
has been misinterpreted. A modest increase in the maximum speed should
be easily feasible with the existing hardware and would dramatically reduce
the size of the zenith blind spot.

<P>8. The source of the axis runaways must be found and corrected.

<P>9. An axis over speed detection interlock must be implemented.

<P>10. The design of the TPM and utility software should be internally
reviewed, decided upon, and documented. The implementation should then
proceed quickly.

<P>11. The project needs to generate and implement a policy regarding the
bypassing of interlocks.

<P>12. It appears that there is some risk to the telescope and primary
mirror in the event that the telescope runs into a hard stop or the windscreen
at zero degrees elevation.

<P>13. A slip detection system should be implemented. A procedure for recovery
from a slip fault should be decided upon and formalized.
