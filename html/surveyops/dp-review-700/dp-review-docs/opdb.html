<P><FONT size=5><STRONG>Operational Database 
</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The Operational Database (OPDB) archives and provides efficient 
access to all data necessary for the conduct of Survey Operations. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>Implementation </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The OPDB consists of two components: </FONT></P>
<OL>
  <LI><FONT size=2>A commercial object-oriented database (OODB, Objectivity), 
  providing disk-based storage to that data which must be efficiently accessed 
  for normal Survey Operations. Access to the data is via C++ and TCL wrappers 
  for the C++ code. </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>A hierarchical tape storage system, providing storage of 
  pixel-based data (raw and corrected images, atlas images, masks, etc), for 
  which efficient access is not required for normal Survey Operations. 
  </FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>Functions </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The OPDB provides the following functions (all but the first are 
implemented entirely within the OODB):</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>Archives the Data Acquistion Sytems (DA) and Pipeline outputs. 
  </FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P><FONT size=2>Multiple copies of all data are stored. The DA and Pipeline 
    outputs can be reproduced "exactly" from the OPDB. The exact manner in which 
    the Pipelines ran are recorded, including the Pipeline version, settings for 
    tunable parameters, and the specific inputs to the 
  Pipelines.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=2>Provides efficient recalibration of the raw Pipeline 
  outputs.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P><FONT size=2>The raw outputs (pixels, counts, etc) from the ps and frames 
    Pipeline are stored in the OODB, along with the astrometric and photometric 
    calibrations (from the astrom and fcalib Pipelines, respectively). Multiple 
    calibrations may be stored. Calibrations may be applied on the fly. New 
    calibrations may be obtained by re-running the astrom and fcalib Pipelines 
    from inputs reproduced from the OODB alone (re-running ssc, ps, and photo 
    all require fetching inputs from the hierarchical tape storage system). 
    </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=2>Provides efficient QA.</FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P><FONT size=2>Objects in overlapping areas are matched up in the OODB. 
    Tools are provided to perform QA based on the matched pairs. 
  </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><FONT size=2>Tracks survey progress. </FONT></P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <P><FONT size=2>The following functions are performed within the OODB (on 
    "lite" versions of the objects for efficiency) to track survey progress: 
    </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">

    <OL>
      <LI><FONT size=2>Objects in overlapping regions are matched. </FONT></LI>
      <LI><FONT size=2>Data quality is assigned on a field-by-field basis. 
      </FONT></LI>
      <LI><FONT size=2>Pieces of sky are defined as done by assigning segments 
      of imaging scans, along with specific astrometric and photometric 
      calibrations, to those pieces of sky. Objects within those segments are 
      assigned as "primary" or "secondary" survey objects.</FONT></LI></OL></OL></OL>
<P><FONT size=2>Perform target selection.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>Target selection is performed within the OODB, applying 
  calibrations on the fly.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>Track tile assignment and plate drilling.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>All spectroscopic targets assigned to tiles are recorded in 
  the OODB. Each time tiling is run, the OODB provides the list of untiled 
  spectroscopic targets. Similar functionality is providing in support of plate 
  drilling. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT size=2>Export calibrated objects to the Science Database. </FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>Calibrated objects are exported to the Science Database. 
  Objects may be re-exported when new calibrations are available. 
</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>Status </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>All functions outlined above are currently supported. The 
performance speed in all cases is satisfactory. There have been no problems to 
date as the database grows (the size of the OODB component is currently 40 
Gbytes). Security of archived data has yet to be proven. Problems, due to bugs 
in the commercial OODB, have been encountered both with schema evolution and 
incremental backups (work arounds exist for both problems).</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG>Still To Do </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>The following functionality is not yet implemented: </FONT></P>
<OL>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Archive Spectroscopic Pipeline outputs. While the 
  Spectroscopic DA outputs are archived, the Pipeline outputs currently are not. 
  </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Full back-up strategy must be implemented. Currently, 
  back-ups are done by hand on a semi-regular basis. Next release of the 
  commercial OODB should support the full implementation. </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Data verification tools. </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Interface to survey planning tools. </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Interface to more of the day-to-day tasks of Survey 
  Operations (tracking data reductions, etc). </FONT></LI>
  <LI><FONT size=2>Archiving Photometric Telescope data and reductions within 
  the OODB (which is currently fully supported, however we're not doing it now, 
  and may never want to). </FONT></LI></OL>
