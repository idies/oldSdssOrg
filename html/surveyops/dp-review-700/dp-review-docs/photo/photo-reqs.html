<b><font size=+2>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
FOR THE SDSS PHOTOMETRIC PIPELINE</font></b>
<p>Steve Kent (Fermilab) and Jill Knapp (Princeton)<br>
January 29, 1998
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><br>
The following document is an edited version of two parts of "Data Processing
Requirements for SDSS Offline Software", written by Steve Kent (January
9 1995; sdss-sac #52).&nbsp; The first part is the introduction, containing
the overall requirements for the entire offline data processing system,
and the second is the section dealing with the photometric pipeline. This
section has been updated to take into account two changes.&nbsp; First,
we no longer expect to process any data taken by the Fermilab Drift Scan
Camera on the 3.5 m telescope, and second, the postage stamp extraction
is now done by a new pipeline, the serial stamp collecting pipeline, instead
of by the DA system.
<p>Photo now consists of three pipelines:
<p>The SSC, which cuts and orders the five color data to make the frames,
and cuts several sets of postage stamps: 65x65 pixel stamps at the positions
of stars found in the astrometric chips, 200x200 pixel stamps at the positions
of stars brighter than 14m to measure the wings (one star per frame), and
every 30 frames or so, extracts an entire frame with a very bright star
to measure the image ghosts.&nbsp; Since SSC is basically a bookkeeping
task, there are no requirements per se on this pipeline.
<p>The PSP, which processes the quartile data from the DA and the postage
stamp data from SSC and produces the run of sky, flat and PSF data for
an entire run.
<p>Frames, which processes the data frame by frame, finds and measures
objects and writes a series of output files and images.
<p>Apart from these changes and fixing the occasional typo, no changes
have been made to the requirements as presented in the Jan 1995 document,
though some outputs have been added to Photo and we could fill in quite
a few of the TBDs; the goal is to compare these requirements with Photo's
current performance.
<p>The entire software document is included at the end for reference.

<p>6. Specific to 1-D simulations:

<br>&nbsp;REQUIREMENTS FOR TARGET SELECTION

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; individual runs and apply astrometric and photometric
calibrations and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; reddening corrections.&nbsp; The following operations
will be provided:

magnitude in r'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;lt; 18; SB(r') &amp;lt; 22; star/galaxy
shape parameter P &amp;lt; some value.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a') Big galaxies: All
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) QSO: all objects with reddening corrected PSF magnitudes
and colors
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; satisfying criteria defined by the QSO
working group
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) High z QSO: all objects with reddening corrected PSF
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; magnitudes and colors satisfying color
criteria defined by the QSO
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working group
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Brightest cluster member: all objects with the BCM
target selection
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flag set
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Blank Sky: As selected by Photo.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Reddening Stars: shape and color selection criteria

flag set
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; k) Stars: shape and color selection criteria TBD
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; l) Bright stars: All cataloged stars with V &amp;lt; 9
<p>3. Tiling: Group target candidates into "tiles" of diameter 3.0 deg
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; and 640 fibers optimized to minimize time-to-completion
of survey.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The following operations will be performed:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Create Tilable Object List: Combine the lists of galaxy,
QSO, High z QSO,
<br>&nbsp;and BCM targets and reconcile close pairs as follows.&nbsp; Scan
for pairs
<br>&nbsp;of targets closer than 50 arcseconds. Eliminate one of member
<br>&nbsp;by a random lottery, except that high Z QSOs will always be retained.
<br>&nbsp;The excluded target is put at the top of the "as fibers are
<br>&nbsp;available" list.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Tile: Assign each tile to a position
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the local density of targets,
assign the plate centers. Use an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; algorithm that optimizes the time to
completion for the survey. Note
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the efficiency of the algorithm
may be affected by the shape of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; region. We allow 10^-3 of the targets
to be missed when their
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inclusion seriously affects the tiling
efficiency. The central 3.2mm of
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tile can not contain a target. Plate
"jiggling" may be used
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to meet this requirement.&nbsp; The
plate diameter is 3 degrees.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUTS:
<br>&nbsp;i) Tilable object list (Objects within 1 degree of the outer
boundary
<br>&nbsp;of the photometric survey are not required to be selected)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) Number of tiles to be used
<br>&nbsp;iii) Number of fibers reserved for tilable objects (561) (TBD:
Is
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this OK?)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; OUTPUTS (tiling report):
<br>&nbsp;i) Ra, Dec (J2000) for each tile
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii) List of objects per tile
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Assign reserved targets to tiles as follows:
<br>&nbsp;i) Blank sky: 20 (Uniform distribution)
<br>&nbsp;ii) Reddening stars: 5 (TBD OK?) (Uniform distribution)
<br>&nbsp;iii) Secondary spectrophotometric standards: 3
<br>&nbsp;iv) Tracking stars: 10 total (no fibers)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v) Sky monitor fiber: 1
(special purpose fiber)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Assign targets to free fibers: The "as fibers are available"
targets
<br>&nbsp;are used with the following priority:
<br>&nbsp;i) Targets excluded by the minimum separation requirement
<br>&nbsp;ii) Remaining targets with the following percentages: stars 26%;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serendipity 12%; QA
62%
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Light traps for bright stars: TBD: How will we deal
with these at
<br>&nbsp;plugging time???????
<p>4. Plate Design: Convert celestial coordinates to rectilinear coordinates
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; for drilling with rms mapping error no worse than 20 marcsec
rms.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; INPUT:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Date range
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Correct for the following effects:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Aberration
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Atmospheric refraction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Optical mapping from sky to focal plane
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Plate bending distortions;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; e) Temperature (TBD: where does this occur?)
<p>
<br>&nbsp;REQUIREMENT FOR QUALITY ANALYSIS
<p>QA will provide a mechanism to monitor the scientific and technical
performance
<br>of all systems.
<p>QA will perform the following activities:
<p>1. Match multiple detections of same object in arbitrary independent
<br>&nbsp;runs (TBD: This may be a target selection function instead?);
<br>&nbsp;compute average and residuals in position, mag.
<p>2. Match object detections against arbitrary input catalogs.&nbsp; Each
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; catalog provides the following information: Ra, Dec (J2000),
error,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; magnitude in some band; compute average and residuals
in position, mag.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>3. Query all retained output for the following information:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; a) All retained instrumental quantities
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; b) All reduced quantities
