to be informed of others): M. Bernardi, S. Burles, F. Castander, A.

<P>
<H3>I. Overview of the Spectroscopic Pipeline</H3>
<P> </P>
<H4>1. Purposes of the pipeline</H4>
<P> The spectroscopic pipeline is designed to be a multi-purpose, highly 
automated pipeline for processing the 10^6 galaxy, QSO, and stellar spectra 
from the SDSS spectrographs. This is an unprecedented challenge, mitigated 
by the very high quality spectra these spectrographs produce. </P>
<P>The pipeline is designed to extract and process all spectra taken in the 
course of the Survey, and specifically to: 
<UL>
  <LI>archive the reduced, red/blue combined, co-added 1d spectra 
  <LI>classify objects (Star, Galaxy, QSO) independently of the target selection 
  pipeline 
  <LI>estimate redshifts and provide spectral information for all objects 
  possible, with  required redshift accuracy and success rates depending on 
  object type (see Sect. II) </LI></UL>
<P> In addition to the above goals, which enable science to be carried 
out with the spectra, the pipeline has the following roles in survey 
operations: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>provides near real-time diagnostic S/N outputs for APO observers so that 
   exposure time for each plate can be determined under varying conditions; 
  this is a critical element in determining Survey time to completion 
  <LI>provides diagnostic outputs for spectroscopic data processors at Fermilab 
  so that  data quality on each processed plate can be rapidly assessed as 
  satisfying Survey scientific requirements or not (i.e., a check on the 
  previous point); these outputs also provide QA monitoring of the 
  spectrographic system over time 
  <LI>provides feedback to target selection on object classification and on 
  redshift success rates for different object classes as function of 
  magnitude, surface brightness, etc; this allows the Working groups to 
  optimize TS parameters for survey efficiency and completeness </LI></UL>
<P> Aside from these functions in survey operations, the Spectroscopic 
pipeline is not a critical-path item for the Survey to operate.  
</P>
<P>
<P>
<P> 
<H4>2. Structure and Functionality of the Pipeline</H4>
<P> N.B.: The available documentation on the design of the spectroscopic 
pipeline is unfortunately out of date (the last major update to the printed 
documentation was at the time of the Spectroscopic pipeline review in April 
'99). This will be rectified in the next few months, when technical papers 
describing the 1d and 2d pipelines will be prepared for publication. 
</P>
<P>The Spectroscopic pipeline is split operationally into two parts, 2d and 
1d. The 2d pipeline reduces the raw data and calibration images from the red 
and blue CCD cameras from each spectrograph and outputs merged, combined, 
flux-calibrated spectra and noise for analysis by the 1d pipeline. The 1d 
pipeline determines emission and absorption redshifts, classifies spectra by 
object type, and outputs spectral information about each object. During 
normal data processing operations at Fermilab, a batch of spectroscopic 
plates is first run through the 2d pipeline and then through 1d.  
<P> 
<H4>Spectro2d</H4>
<P> In October of 1999, it was determined that the then-current version 
of 2d, which was built around IRAF commands, was not flexible or robust 
enough to satisfy the Survey requirements. The Spectro2d pipeline was 
completely rewritten from scratch by S. Burles and D. Schlegel in IDL 
(idlspec2d). The current version of the code used for data 
processing (3c) was tagged in early May of this year and was 
then determined to meet the Survey Requirements of this year and 
was determined to meet the Survey Requirements in early May. </P>
<P><B>Key Tasks of Spectro2d</B>  
<UL>
  <LI>Overscan 
  <LI>Bias and dark subtraction 
  <LI>Spatial tracing of fiber images from flat-field image 
  <LI>Optimal extraction of flats and arcs 
  <LI>Wavelength calibration from arc lamps and sky lines 
  <LI>Flat-fielding: remove spectral response using flat exposures; remove pixel 
  to pixel response using uniformly illuminated flats 
  <LI>Optimal Object and sky extraction, including scattered light removal 
  <LI>Sky subtraction using supersky built from sky fibers 
  <LI>Telluric absorption removal using spectrophotometric standard spectra 
  <LI>Flux calibration from spectrophotometric standard (F) stars spectra 
  <LI>Output spectrum, variance, and pixel mask information 
  <LI>Rebin spectra and merge red and blue halves; heliocentric correction 
  <LI>Combine multiple 15-minute exposures as needed to reach required S/N per 
  plate (multiple-night exposures are combined if necessary, but not if a 
  plate has been replugged) 
  <LI>Output diagnostic information on cumulative S/N per plate: this is used by 
  the spectroscopic data processors to decide if a given plate satisfies 
  Survey requirements and can be declared "good, done" (and unplugged). The 
  current requirement is that the mean (S/N)^2  100 for objects with fiber 
  magnitudes of g'=19.2, r'=19.25, i'=18.9 in each spectrograph. This 
  limit will be reviewed and refined in the next month (see below) 
  <LI>Output other diagnostic information that provides QA monitoring on the 
  spectroscopic system (e.g., errors in wavelength solution, QA for 
  scattered light levels, throughput compared to PHOTO g,r,i magnitudes, 
  etc) </LI></UL>
<P> For a list of the routines used in idlspec2d, see <A 
href="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/idlspectro2d.html" >IDL Help for IDLSPEC2d</A>.  </P>
<P>In addition, a faster, stripped-down version of the 2d pipeline is run on 
the mountain during spectroscopic observations. This mountain-top version of 
the 2d pipeline 
<UL>
  <LI>provides "real-time" information to the APO observers on the 
  approximate S/N achieved per 15-minute exposure </LI></UL>
<P>Based on this information, the APO observers carry out as many 
spectroscopic exposures on a plate as are necessary under the given 
conditions to achieve the cumulative (S/N)^2 deemed necessary to meet the 
Survey requirements. Currently, this is set at (S/N)^2  80 at the same 
magnitudes as above; this translates approximately to (S/N)^2  100 in 
idlspec2d.   </P>
<P>  
<H4>Spectro1d</H4>
<P> The 1d pipeline, which analyzes the combined spectra output by 
spectro2d, is written in C and TCL. A velocity dispersion module written in 
IDL has been recently added. The version of the code currently used in data 
processing, 1d_4 was/will be cut on July 10 of this year. The code outputs a 
FITS image for each fiber: it includes the 1d spectrum, noise, and mask 
array from 2d, basic information about the target from PHOTO and TS, as well 
as line measurements and redshift determinations. These outputs are listed 
in the (unofficial) <A href="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/spectrodatamodel.txt">Spectro Data Model</A>; the 
schema of outputs of the pipeline as they will appear to the SX database can 
be found at <A href="http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/sx/spectro.html">this Web site</A>. 
Although out of date, general information about the structure of the 1d 
pipeline can be found at the <A 
href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/spectrodoc/doc/www/spectrodoc.home.html">Spectro 
Pipeline Home Page</A>.   </P>
<P><B>Key Tasks of Spectro1d</B>  
<UL>
  <LI>Fit and subtract continuum 
  <LI>Find and fit emission lines (using a wavelet filter) 
  <LI>Identify emission lines and determine an emission-line redshift and error 
  where possible 
  <LI>Cross-correlate the spectra with stellar, galaxy, and QSO templates to 
  determine a cross-correlation redshift and error (emission lines are 
  removed in this procedure, except for the QSO template) 
  <LI>Classify all object spectra as Galaxy, QSO, high-redshift QSO, Star, or 
  unknown (currently a discrete choice) 
  <LI>Output a final redshift by comparing emission and absorption redshift 
  confidence levels; final redshift determination is denoted high 
  confidence, low confidence, inconsistent, or failed 
  <LI>Output information on identified emission and absorption lines (equivalent 
  widths, etc) 
  <LI>Output warning flags for spectra (e.g., blue or red half of spectrum 
  missing; conflicting high-CL cross-correlation redshifts; outlier redshift 
  for object class; classification differs from TS) 
  <LI>Flag low-confidence level redshift determinations for subsequent 
  inspection and interactive z-determination 
  <LI>Provide interactive redshift determination environment for inconsistent, 
  failed, and other spectra: to be used by Spectro pipeline developers to 
  manually determine redshifts. It is expected that this will be necessary 
  for a few percent of all spectra; also to be used on a spotcheck basis for 
  QA monitoring. 
  <LI>Estimate velocity dispersion and error for galaxies 
  <LI>Provide diagnostic output for Spectroscopic data processors to monitor QA

<H4>2. Spectroscopic Requirements and Current Performance</H4>
<P> The requirements on the performance of the SDSS Spectroscopic 
pipeline are described in two documents: Section 7 of the <A 
href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/scireq/scireq.html">Scientific 
Requirements and Scientific Commissioning for the SDSS</A> and the <A 
href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/softreq/softreq.html">Offline 
software processing requirements</A>. Note also that some of the 
requirements on the spectroscopic system are implicitly linked to 
requirements on Target Selection enumerated in Section 6 of the <A 
href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/scireq/scireq.html">Scientific 
Requirements and Scientific Commissioning for the SDSS</A>.  </P>
<P>The current status of the Spectroscopic pipeline in terms of the Survey 
requirements is described in varying levels of detail in three documents: 
 
<OL>
  <LI>Michael Strauss' document <A 
  href="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/requirements/requirements.html">status 
  of requirements</A> for the survey provides a general overview. 
  <LI>Andy Connolly's document <A 
  href="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/spectro-req-review.pdf">Requirements 
  and Status of the SDSS Spectroscopic Systems</A> describes the status of 
  the SDSS spectroscopic hardware and software with regard to the 
  requirements set out in Sect. 7 of the <A 
  href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/scireq/scireq.html">Scientific 
  Requirements and Scientific Commissioning for the SDSS</A> 
  <LI>Mark Subbarao's webpage <A 
  href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/spectrodoc/doc/www/requirements/sp1dRequirements.html"> 
  Status of 1d with respect to SDSS Science requirements</A> describes the 
  current performance of the 1d pipeline with respect to the requirements 
  set out in Sec. 7 of the <A 
  href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/scireq/scireq.html">Scientific 
  Requirements and Scientific Commissioning for the SDSS</A> as well as 
  those set out in the <A 
  href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/requirements/doc/www/softreq/softreq.html">Offline

  page have been incorporated into <A 
  href="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/spectro-req-review.pdf">Requirements 
  and Status of the SDSS Spectroscopic Systems</A>. The numbers reported on 
  this page are based on comparison of spectro1d outputs (using the checked-out 
  version of the code as of 6/23/00) with manual determination of 
  redshifts on several plates of varying S/N taken in the Spring of this 
  year. Over the next month, all reduced spectroscopic plates taken so far 
  (over 40) will be manually checked; this will allow more accurate 
  statistics on pipeline and spectroscopic system performance as a function 
  of plate S/N to be compiled. </LI></OL>
<P> </P>
<P><B>Summary on Pipeline Status and Requirements</B> 
<P> Based on tests carried out and summarized in the documents above, 
 
<UL>
  <LI>idlspectro2d is deemed to satisfy the Survey science requirements 
  <LI>spectro1d satisfies most of the Survey science requirements at the current 
  minimum acceptable S/N level per plate. This includes the requirements on 
  redshift success rates for galaxies, BRGs, and QSOs, the redshift accuracy 
  requirements on galaxies and QSOs (though these have only been tested 
  internally; external comparison is difficult and remains to be carried 
  out), and the successful classification of galaxy and QSO spectra as such. 
  </LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<P>The spectro1d requirements which are not yet satisfied or verified are 
the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Although 95% of QSO spectra are successfully classified as such, the 
  requirements also state that 99% of the QSO spectra not correctly 
  classified should be classified as unknown. Currently the majority of 
  misclassified QSO spectra (typically 0 or 1 per plate) are instead 
  identified as stars or galaxies by the pipeline. It is the goal of the 
  pipeline that misclassified QSO spectra will be flagged for manual 
  classification and redshift determination. 
  <LI>Currently 96% of stellar spectra are correctly classified by the pipeline 
  (based on 5 plates), while the requirement is 99%. This will be addressed 
  by the addition of hot and cool stellar templates for the 
  cross-correlation analysis. 
  <LI>The status of the requirement on the accuracy of BAL QSO redshifts is not 
  yet known; internal reproducibility is within the required accuracy 
  limit, but comparison with manual redshift determinations needs to be done. 
  This will occur in the next few weeks. </LI></UL>
<P> Note: internal and external verification of redshift accuracy 
for galaxies at the 30 km/sec level is a difficult problem. The pipeline 
developers will compare 1d redshifts with high-resolution redshifts from the 
literature where available. Aside from this, manual determination of 
redshifts of all the spectra taken so far (~42 plates) will be used as a 
"truth table"; statistical comparison with these manual redshifts will be 
used to determine whether the pipeline meets the science requirements of the 
survey.    </P>
<P>
<HR>

<P></P>
<P>
<H3>III. Future Development of the Spectroscopic Pipeline</H3>
<P></P>
<P>
<H4>1. Remaining Tasks and Estimated Time to Completion</H4>
<P></P>
<P>The near-term prioritized tasks for the 1d pipeline listed here are aimed 
at satisfying the remaining Survey science requirements. It is expected that 
these will be completed by 9/1/00: 
<OL>
  <LI>Add stellar templates to improve stellar classification success rate 
  <LI>Improve QSO classification scheme so that unclassified QSO spectra are 
  flagged for visual inspection 
  <LI>Manually determine redshifts and classification for all objects on all 
  plates observed so far; this will be used to check classification and 
  redshift success rates as functions of plate S/N and thus to determine 
  required plate S/N for survey operations. It will also be used to determine 
  whether additional parameters beyond plate S/N need to be checked in 
  declaring plates "done". 
  <LI>Recalibrate emission and absorption redshift Confidence Levels using 
  manual redshifts above. 
  <LI>Implement redshift warning flags (e.g., missing half-spectra, discordant 
  high-CL redshift determinations, etc) 
  <LI>Check external accuracy of redshifts where possible from the literature 

  <LI>Check BAL QSO redshifts against manual determination from the QSO working 
  group to verify required accuracy 
  <LI>Improve continuum fitting algorithm (expected to improve QSO redshift 
  success and classification) </LI></OL>
<P> In addition to these tasks, both the 2d and 1d pipelines need to 
implement regression tests to ensure code robustness in the course of future 
development. </P>
<P>
<H4>2. Enhanced Goals and Estimated Time to Achieve Them</H4>
<P></P>
<P><B>Spectro2d:</B> 
<P>It is expected that the following enhanced goals will be achieved by 
approximately 10/1/00: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>output estimated error covariance in addition to variance 
  <LI>implement code to reduce binned diamond-pattern exposures 
  <LI>improve flux calibration based on spectrophotometric standards? 
</LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P><B>Spectro1d:</B> 
<P>The following enhanced goals of Spectro1d are expected to be achieved at 
various stages, but in all cases by the end of 2000; they are listed in 
expected order of completion: 
<OL>
  <LI>Test and finalize galaxy velocity dispersion code 
  <LI>Output line indices 
  <LI>Implement galaxy and QSO spectral classification using eigenspectrum (PCA) analysis 
  
  <LI>Implement stellar spectral classification using non-continuum-subtracted 
  spectra/templates 
  <LI>Determine feasibility of galaxy spectrophotometry using diamond-pattern 
  exposures; implement to the extent possible </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P><B>3. Long-term Staffing Needs</B> 
<P>The long-term staffing needs for the spectroscopic pipeline are based on 
the two roles that will be needed during Survey Operations: 
<OL>
  <LI>Long-term code maintenance: QA monitoring; possible code development 
  necessary if hardware changes significantly (i.e., some component breaks 
  or degrades over time); possible additional enhancements desired by the 
  collaboration; provide assistance as needed to Spectroscopic data processors 
  at Fermilab 
  <LI>Interactive Redshift Determination: this will be carried out by the 
  pipeline developers over the course of the Survey for up to a few percent 
  of all spectra. This will provide z determinations and object 
  classifications for objects where the automated pipeline cannot make a 
  determination as well as provide spotchecking of the automated pipeline 
  for QA. </LI></OL>
<P></P>
<P>The anticipated long-term staffing level (2001 and beyond) needed to meet 
these requirements is 1 FTE supported by ARC.     
</P>
