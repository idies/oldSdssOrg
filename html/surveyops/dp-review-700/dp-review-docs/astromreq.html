<P>The key task of SDSS astrometry is to ensure that the positions of the holes 
drilled for spectroscopic fibers are sufficiently accurate that spectroscopic 
targets are well-centered on the fibers. For a variety of reasons (see the 
Astrometry Chapter of the SDSS Project Book for details), this means that SDSS 
must determine the absolute positions of objects detected by the imaging camera. 
(While the key science drivers for SDSS are clearly driven by the spectroscopy, 
the imaging part of the Survey will result in a large database which will be a 
significant resource for decades to come. Obviously, we would like the positions 
of all detected objects to be determined as accurately as feasible.) </P>
<P>Spectroscopic targets are chosen from objects detected by the main 
(photometric) array of CCDs in the imaging camera, which saturate for 
point-source objects brighter than about 14th magnitude. Sufficiently accurate 
all-sky astrometric catalogs are not available for stars fainter than about 12th 
magnitude. Consequently the imaging camera was designed with a second 
(astrometric) array of CCDs. These astrometric CCDs precede and trail the 
photometric CCDs in camera columns. The bandpass of the astrometric CCDs is 
similar to the SDSS photometric r' bandpass, but the saturation level is about 
5.5 magnitude brighter. Objects on the sky pass down a camera column as the 
telescope is driven along a great circle and the CCDs are read-out synchronously 
in drift-scan mode. Hence an object will pass through, in sequence, the imaging 
area of the leading astrometric CCD, then the five photometric CCDs (in order 
r', i', u', z', g'), and finally, the trailing astrometric CCD. </P>
<P>Stars detected by the astrometric CCDs span a range of magnitudes from about 
8.5 to nearly 17 while those on the photometrics reach from about 14th magnitude 
to beyond 20th (depending on the bandpass). Thus the astrometric CCDs can detect 
and measure not only bright stars from an astrometric catalog (currently 
Tycho-2), but also a significant number of stars between 14th and 17th magnitude 
which also appear on the photometric CCDs. The brighter reference stars are 
mapped onto the fainter stars and a transformation from photometric device 
coordinates (CCD row, column) to celestial coordinates is derived. 
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4><A name="SECTION0300"><STRONG>Astrometric Requirements </STRONG>  </A></FONT></P>
<P>There are two categories of requirements for SDSS astrometric performance. 
One stipulates how well the survey must do in the determination of absolute 
positions on the sky (as measured in the r' band) of point-source objects 
brighter than r' = 19, and the other how well the relative positions of objects 
measured in the four band passes (u', g', i',z') must match up with the r' 
position. </P>
<P>Each astrometric requirement is expressed as an rms figure per coordinate in 
units of milli-arcseconds (hereinafter mas) along a great circle. The 
requirements apply to objects with ``normal'' spectral distributions (e.g. stars 
of spectral type O5 through M0). Extremely blue or red objects and/or 
emission-line objects will occasionally fail to meet the requirements due to 
chromatic differential refraction (DCR). It is expected that the requirements 
herein will be satisfied for each ``acceptable imaging run.'' Here an acceptable 
imaging run is a scan of length no less than 20 minutes (exclusive of 
``ramp-up'' frames), airmass less than or equal to 2.0, and seeing less than or 
equal to 1.5 arcsec (FWHM), with the absolute telescope pointing error no worse 
than 3 arcsec rms (2-D on the sky) and relative telescope tracking error no 
worse than 50 mas (1-D on the sky) on time scales of 1-10 minutes. 
</P>

<P>There are three different levels of requirement for absolute astrometry: </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><A NAME="SECTION0302">Requirements on Relative Astrometry </STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>There are also three different levels of requirement for relative astrometry: 
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>The <EM>Drop-Dead </EM>  requirement - if the relative astrometry does not meet 
  this, the run will be deemed unacceptable since core survey science would be

  mas. </STRONG></LI></OL>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><A NAME="SECTION0400">Absolute Astrometry Performance </A></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>The ideal, direct way to determine astrometric performance is simply to 
compare star positions determined with SDSS with those determined externally. 
Since positions of objects in the r' photometric bandpass are required, it is 
necessary to compare positions of stars which are fainter than 14th magnitude 
(and indeed down to 19th to fully satisfy the requirement). There are no 
wide-area astrometric catalogs available for stars fainter than 14th which are 
accurate enough to verify SDSS astrometry. </P>
<P>However, the Naval Observatory is presently constructing 
an all-sky CCD catalog (The USNO Astrometric Catalog or <EM>UCAC</EM>          
      ) which reaches fainter than 16th 
magnitude. At present, the survey is underway in the Southern hemisphere. Some 
of the UCAC observations now reach to the southernmost SDSS survey regions. </P>
<P>Some of the SDSS equatorial scans covered regions where UCAC observations 
have been made. For example Run 745 was an equatorial parked scan conducted UT 
March 20, 1999. SDSS positions were matched against the UCAC preliminary catalog 
and the results are shown in the following figure: </P>
<DIV align=center>
<HR align=center style="HEIGHT: 2px; WIDTH: 628px">
&nbsp;</DIV>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/astromreq/ucac745.gif"></P>
<DIV align=center>
<HR align=center style="HEIGHT: 2px; WIDTH: 628px">
&nbsp;</DIV>
<P>These results are extremely encouraging, but we should realize that such a 
run represents a best-case scenario for the following reasons: </P>
<P>* The telescope was parked and clamped on the equator at the meridian during 
the observations so that no telescope motion was involved: telescope pointing or 
tracking errors were not a consideration. <BR>* A number of astrometric calibration fields lie along the 
equator (so-called FASTT fields, dense astrometric grids of stars produced by 
the USNO for the purpose of calibrating the SDSS imaging camera geometry), so 
that a well-calibrated focal-plane model, generated from the very data being 
reduced, was available to be used for the <STRONG>astrom</STRONG>     
          
             
           
              
 pipeline reductions. </P>
<P>For a worst-case scenario, we turn to Run 1449, which 
was observed recently (UT May 3, 2000) on SDSS' southern-most stripe (Stripe 1). 
A comparison of astrometry from that run with 5555 UCAC star positions show a 
mean offset in RA of -11 mas, rms of 119 mas, and in DEC, 7 mas +/- 139 mas. 
Frankly, this run was not particularly good from an astrometric viewpoint. The 
atmosphere was particularly troublesome. This is probably due to how far south 
the stripe is (DEC of -22.5), which means that the observations must be 
conducted at an airmass of 2.0. The following figure shows data from one of six 
Camera Columns for Run 1449. Note the significant excursions traced by the 
astrometric residuals. We believe that these are due to atmospheric 
fluctuations. The grossest such excursions are fitted and removed by the 
<STRONG>astrom</STRONG>             
             
               
                   
          
             
             
              
           
           
          pipeline, and the 
points here show the residuals after such fitting.</P>
<P>A possible further contributing factor with run 1449 is that the telescope 
was required to track a great circle which changed very little in azimuth or 
elevation during the run. The altitude axis rate ranged from only -0.1 
arcsec/sec to 1.5 arcsec/sec, while the azimuth axis rate ranged from 1.3 to 1.4 
arcsec/sec. Such slow rates may be difficult to sustain uniformly.</P>
<P>The next figure shows the residuals in RA and DEC from one r' CCD (13) from 
Run 1449. There are significant systematic swings in the residuals along the 
scan. We've assumed that these are due to atmospheric effects. More is said 
about this below in the following section. </P>
<HR align=center style="HEIGHT: 2px; WIDTH: 628px">

<P align=center><IMG SRC="/surveyops/dp-review-700/dp-review-docs/astromreq/abs1449.gif"></P>
<HR align=center style="HEIGHT: 2px; WIDTH: 628px">
<P>We expect that the absolute astrometry may also suffer when the 
telescope is required to track at very high axis rates (i.e. near the zenith). 
In such circumstances, it is difficult to keep the instrument rotator positioned 
so that stars track straight down the camera CCD columns. Unfortunately there 
are no calibrated astrometric catalogs above the equator which reach faint 
enough magnitudes yet, and so we cannot do a direct comparison. </P>
<P>We can, however, compare SDSS-determined positions of stars which appear 
within the overlap regions of adjacent or interleaved strips. Run 1345 is 
notorious (at least among the astrometrists) for its high tracking rates (the 
azimuth rate exceeded 50 arcsec/sec at the beginning of the run). Comparing the 
positions of 953 stars from this run with matching positions from Run 1331 (an 
interleaved strip of the same Great Circle) yields a mean error in RA of -22 mas 
+/- 103, and in DEC of 60 +/- 120. </P>
<P>In summary, the absolute astrometry consistently meets 
the <STRONG>Drop-Dead </STRONG>requirement, surpasses the <STRONG>Science Goals 
</STRONG>Requirement when extreme conditions are not being encountered, and 
approaches the <STRONG>Enhanced Goals </STRONG> requirement under ideal conditions. </P>

<P><FONT size=4><STRONG><A NAME="SECTION0500">Relative Astrometry Performance </A></STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>The relative astrometry between bands currently being delivered consistently 
betters both the Drop-Dead and Science Goals requirements and is flirting with 
the Enhanced Goals requirement in all but the u' band, even for the 
aforementioned run 1449, as shown in the following table. (The numbers here are 
taken directly from the calibrated object files for stars brighter than 19th 
magnitude.) Relative (CCD-to-CCD) Astrometry&nbsp;</P><EM>

<P>It is worth noting, however, that while these formal results are encouraging, 
they hide much that is interesting if not troubling. The next figure shows the

<P>However, the next figure shows the same offsets as a function of RA for about 
one degree (in RA) of the scan. While Run 1449 was observed on a great circle 
with a modest amount of inclination to the equator (22.5 degrees), changes in RA 
correspond quite closely to changes in clock time at nearly a sidereal rate (1 
degree of RA is nearly 4 minutes of scanning). Note the swings on the order of 
+/- 100 mas over short time scales. We believe, though are not 100% convinced, 
that this is the atmosphere at work. We continue to investigate these problems.

<P>The astrometric solution is modeled as a linear transformation from pixel 
coordinates to celestial coordinates, one transformation per CCD per frame. 
High-order terms model optical distortions (as a function of column) and 
differential chromatic refraction (DCR, as a function of color). Various 
systematic effects cannot be completely removed by the adopted model. Typical 
seeing introduces systematics of order 20-50 mas. The rms error measure is, in 
fact, dominated by systematic errors due to seeing. DCR in the g' filter can 
introduce systematic errors of up to 20 mas with color. Optical distortions can 
also introduce systematics of the same order. CCD charge transfer inefficiencies 
are also problematic and are currently under active investigation. We are 
currently considering whether it would be worthwhile to adopt a non-linear 
transformation to cope with these systematics. </P>
<P>When faint, all-sky astrometric catalogs, such as UCAC, become available, it 
will be possible to determine the transformation from photometric CCD 
(row,column) to celestial coordinates directly, by-passing the mapping step from 
astrometric CCDs to photometric. At present, it is the astrometric CCD mapping 
which is the largest contributor to the error budget. There are at least two 
reasons for this: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The density of stars increases dramatically with 
  magnitude so that the new catalog will contain many times the number of 
  reference stars and, 
  <LI>The integration time for the astrometric CCDs is only 10.5 seconds, not 
  really enough time to average out short time-scale atmospheric fluctuations 
  (photometric CCDs have an integration time of 54 seconds). </LI></UL>
<P>When UCAC is completed in the Northern hemisphere (this should happen in 
2003), it will be a straight-forward exercise to re-derive the astrometric 
transformations from the new catalog (software is already in the pipeline to do 
this). Since the positions of objects in the databases are stored in device (CCD 
row,column) coordinates, it is a simple matter to generate new celestial 
coordinates by merely changing the transformation coefficients which are applied 
to (row,column) to generate celestial coordinates. </P></A>
