<H2><FONT size=3>Introduction</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT size=2>The Monitor Telescope Observers Program, or 
MOP, provides the interface for the observers on the Photometric Telescope (or 
PT), and implements automated observation of standard stars and secondary 
patches (transfer fields). All functions are available through a command line 
interface, and most are available through a GUI (graphical user interface) as 
well. Procedures common to routine observation are mostly automated. </FONT>

<H2><FONT size=3>Functionality</FONT></H2>
<OL>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Basic telescope, filter wheel box, and 
  camera control</SPAN>. Using MOP, the observer can send basic commands to the 
  telescope, filter wheel box, and camera. These include (but are not limited 
  to) slewing the telescope, setting the filter wheel, opening and closing the 
  shutter, and reading out the CCD. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Target field management</SPAN>. MOP allows 
  the user to load lists of targets into memory, create observing plans using 
  these targets, and then carry them out. MOP loads the locations and contents 
  of primary standard, pointing, and secondary fields from the <SPAN 
  style="FONT-STYLE: italic">mtstds</SPAN> product, and 
  allows the user to load other targets, called "manual targets," from a file 
  owned by the observer. These manual targets can be added interactively or by 
  directly editing the manual target file. MOP can assist the observer in 
  choosing targets by keeping track airmass at extrapolated time of observation, 
  keeping track of which fields have previously been observed at what airmasses, 
  and planning pairs of observations at different airmasses for use in 
  extinction measurements. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Manual and semi-automated 
  observing</SPAN>. An observer 
  may observe by selecting a desired field (or list of fields), and MOP will 
  observe them in sequence. The resulting images can be examined interactively. 
  The observer may also make observations to measure the focus, correct the 
  pointing, and take grid tests. On a more basic level still, the observer may 
  observe by directing the pointing, selecting the filter, opening the shutter 
  for the desired time, and reading out the CCD. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Automated observing</SPAN>. MOP can add targets to the 
  planned target list either at the request of the user, or automatically as it 
  completes observations. MOP attempts to choose targets such that a suitable 
  number of primary standards, in a range of colors and at a range in airmasses, 
  are taken within a sequence of observations, and that any observations not 
  necessary for primary standards are of needed secondary standards. Because the 
  planned target list remains editable by the observer, the automatic selections 
  may be modified by the observer as desired. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Calibration</SPAN>. MOP will take automated sequences of 
  dome flats and biases, and assist the observer in taking twilight flats by 
  measuring the count levels and suggesting exposure times based on a modeled 
  twilight. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Log creation</SPAN>. In addition to the report file 
  required by the pipeline, MOP assists in the creation of a manual log by 
  providing an editor window with appropriate fields for the observer to fill 
  out. Many operations in MOP, particularly the taking of observations, generate 
  log lines which are automatically appended to the manual log. At the end of 
  the night, MOP can send the log to the appropriate mailing 
list.</FONT>

<P><FONT size=2>This procedure usually functions without 
problems. There is a bug which occasionally (once every several nights of 
observing) causes GUI to partially freeze and stops the automatic observation. 
Operation can be restored using one command at the command line. The problem may 
already be fixed, but its intermittent nature means that a number of additional 
nights of observations with the fix are necessary to establish this. </FONT>           
           
            
             
           
        </P>
<P><FONT size=2>Several currently incomplete enhancements 
are desired for improved performance and observer convenience:</FONT>        
   </P>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">fully automated twilight flats<SPAN 
  style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal">. Improved modeling of the twilight to facilitate 
  this is being worked on, but may prove impossible due to night to night 
  variability in the color of the twilight sky. It is likely that this feature 
  would not generally be useful, as dome flats in all filters except <SPAN 
  style="FONT-STYLE: italic">u</SPAN> are likely to be suitable. Automated 
  twilight flats in the <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">u</SPAN> filter only 
  would be much simpler.</SPAN></SPAN> </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">improved automation in secondary field 
  selection</SPAN> 
  Currently, the observer must keep track of which secondary fields need to be 
  observed, and which are completed. A database is being developed which will 
  keep track of which secondary fields have been successfully taken, which have 
  been attempted but have not yet been determined to be of suitable quality, and 
  which of the unobserved fields have the highest priority. When this product is 
  complete, MOP will examine it do determine its choice of secondary patches. 
  </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">integration of partial array reads with 
  automatic target selection</SPAN>. Although MOP may perform partial array reads at the request 
  of the observer, the readout size is not automatically adjusted for each 
  target field. If in the future MOP will automatically read out only the 
  central region of the CCD when primary fields containing only one primary are 
  observed, time will be saved on primary fields. </FONT>
  <LI><FONT size=2><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">automatic focus</SPAN>. Focusing currently requires 
  observer attention. Options for automatic focusing, such as mapping of focus 
  as a function of temperature, are being explored. Note that the focus is 
  sufficiently stable that, on nights with good seeing, near critically sampled 
  images can be maintained throughout the night with only one focus adjustment 
  after the initial focusing for the night.</FONT>   
            
                
             
              
         </LI></UL>
<H2><FONT size=3>Performance</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT size=2>Except for sunrise and sunset, when the 
observer must open and close the dome, and initiate the taking of bias frames 
and flat fields, MOP mostly succeeds in automating a nights observation. The 
observer must still "keep watch" throughout the night to keep the telescope in 
focus, monitor weather conditions, and ensure that MOP continues to run. The 
errors which cause MOP to stop automated observations are being tracked down and 
solved. Possible strategies for automated focusing are being explored. 
</FONT>             
             
           
            
              
          
       </P>
<P><FONT size=2>The PT does not currently observe secondary 
patches at the rate necessary for the survey. Refinement of the exposure times 
(which are currently known to be much longer than necessary) and increased use 
of partial array readouts will significantly speed up observation.</FONT>             
             
            
   </P>
<H2><FONT size=3>Conclusion</FONT></H2>
<P><FONT size=2>MOP's basic functionality is complete: an 
observer may take a nights data conveniently and efficiently, needing only 
periodically to check up on the observations. However, several features 
important for the convenience of the observers are not yet finished. Completion 
and integration of the secondary patch database will become particularly 
important as the survey progresses, as it will become very difficult for the 
observers to keep track of which secondary patches need observation. Work on 
these features</FONT>            
           
          
           
           
              
      , and the general stability of 
the program, is progressing steadily. </P>
