<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT SIZE=+1>I. SDSS SCIENCE REQUIREMENTS</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;In order to confirm that the SDSS hardware and software
can realize the science goals of the project, as laid out in the Principles
of Operation, it is necessary to rephrase these goals in terms of quantifiable
scientific requirements on the systems, for which specific tests can be
carried out to confirm that we are meeting these requirements. In outline,
these requirements are as follows:</FONT>
<DIR><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A. Image Quality and Throughput: the PSF of
the Imaging Camera as a Function of the Free-air Seeing and Position on
the focal Plane.</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In brief, these are designed to give a PSF FWHM of 1.1"
at the edges of the focal plane in the median free-air seeing of the site
(0.8"), and somewhat better on-axis. We are required to reach 1.2 arcseconds
for acceptable image data. In addition, the throughput and camera read-noise
should be such as to yield these magnitude limits for 5 sigma detections
for stellar objects:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>u'=22.3, g'= 23.3, r'=23.1, i'=22.3, z'=20.8</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">B. Photometric Accuracy:</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Our requirements
state a photometric calibration accuracy for bright stars of 0.02 mag in
r', 0.02 mag in the g'-r' and r'-i' colors, and 0.03 mag in u'-g' and i'-z'.
We have developed an 11-item error budget for this, which includes the
uncertainties from the primary standard star system, the photometric solution
for each night, the transformation from the PT to the 2.5m system, any
nonlinearities in either system, and non-uniformities due to varying PSF
across the 2.5m imaging camera.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">C. Astrometric Accuracy:</FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">&nbsp;</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>These are driven
primarily by the need to drill holes for spectroscopic targets; the requirement
is 180 mill-arcsec (mas) rms errors per coordinate. Astrometric science
goals have motivated us to set an enhanced requirement of 100 mas.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">D. Spectrographs:</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;These include requirements on throughput, resolution,
signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift accuracy and reproducibility.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E. Target Selection</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;These put requirements on the uniformity, reproducibility,
and completeness of our three main categories of spectroscopic targets:
the main galaxy sample, the Bright Red Galaxy sample, and the quasars.
These requirements are driven by the large-scale structure science goals
of the SDSS, and the desire to use the fibers as efficiently as possible.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">F. Operations</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>:</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>These requirements are motivated by the need for efficient
operations on the mountain, and sufficiently fast turn-around of data reduction
to keep up with the data flow, and to flag any data that do not meet survey
specifications.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT></DIR>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=+1>II. SCIENCE COMMISSIONING</FONT></FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;Science commissioning refers to the process whereby
we exercise the system in all its aspects, to confirm that it is able to
meet the science requirements of the project. The data that we have gathered
in these commissioning activities have proven to be tremendously valuable
scientifically; although little of it meets our strict survey quality requirements,
we have used it to discover the largest sample yet of high-redshift quasars
and the coolest substellar objects known, to map the distribution of RR
Lyrae stars in the halo of our Galaxy, and to map the distribution of dark
matter around other galaxies via gravitational lensing.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Scientific commissioning consists of obtaining data with
the SDSS telescopes and instruments as they are tuned, analyzing it with
our software, and using the results to diagnose problems, and to check
against the scientific requirements. The data gathered thus far include
more than 1000 square degrees of imaging data, together with calibration
patches from the Photometric Telescope, and 30 spectroscopic plates of
640 spectra each. In brief, the status of the requirements are as follows:</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">A. Image Quality and Throughput<I>:</I></FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;We have seen images as good as 0.75" FWHM on the
focal plane, but unfortunately, the uniformity of the point spread function
across the focal plane has been substantially worse than required. The
seeing at the site is also not as good on average as we had hoped/expected.
We know at this point that we have some trouble with the telescope optics,
and may have trouble with locally induced seeing degradation, perhaps accompanied
by worse-than expected thermal distortion of the mirrors. The bottom line
is that we are having difficulty meeting the 1.2 arcsecond spec on worst-case
image quality across the array; we have seen it, but the conditions which
produce it are not frequent enough for us to proceed. We are considering
backing off to 1.5 arcseconds worst case, at least temporarily. We think
that this has essentially no effect on target selection for the spectroscopic
sample, but this must be verified.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Preliminary measurements indicate that the throughput
of the telescope and camera are better than 80\% of the design values in
all chips, and the read noise in all chips is acceptably low.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">B. Photometric Accuracy<I>:</I></FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The stringent 2 percent accuracy in photometric calibration
will probably only be reached at the END of the survey, when we have five
further years of observations of our photometric standards. At this writing,
the photometric standard star system has been defined to an accuracy of
0.015 mag in all bands except u’, where the internal accuracy is somewhat
worse (.03). Extending this accuracy to the patches used to calibrate the
camera data has proven difficult, due primarily to flat-fielding problems
on the Photometric Telescope, which have been our largest source of systematic
error. We believe now that we have all the (dismayingly many) problems
with the flats solved, but we must check carefully. Another source of systematic
error is the variation in the width of the PSF across single chips in the
2.5m imaging camera; uncorrected, this can cause systematic errors in stellar
photometry of up to 10%, but the Photometric Pipeline now corrects! for
this effect to the 1-2% level.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">C. Astrometric Accuracy:</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;Scans both with a parked telescope on the Celestial
Equator, and powered scans off the Equator, show rms residuals of the astrometric
solutions of better than 150 mas in each coordinate, comfortably within
the requirements. Most of the remaining systematic errors are due to rapid
fluctuations in the atmosphere (so called "anomalous refraction"). We are
investigating ways to model these fluctuations better, and therefore to
reduce these residuals. Recent work comparing astrometric data of our own
from two different runs and comparing our astrometry with that of the 2MASS
infrared survey, which claims 100 mas per coordinate astrometric errors,
shows that we do somewhat better on the sky than the astrometric solutions
indicate, and that we are already at the 100 mas error level. We are still
working to improve the situation further, and have several promising avenues.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">D. Spectrographs:</FONT></B>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>The spectrographs perform extremely well. The measured
throughput of the atmosphere, telescope, fibers, and spectrographs peaks
at 25 percent in the r' band and 18 % in the g' band, which meets specifications.
The resolution of the spectrographs also meets design specifications and
the wavelength coverage of 3850--9200 A exceeds specifications. Wavelength
calibration is at a level of 0.08 A rms deviation for sky lines and the
overall zero point velocity error is on the order of 10 km/s (exceeding
the requirements). Work is on-going on the spectroscopic pipeline to reduce
these data, but it is approaching the goals of correctly classifying and
measuring redshifts for 95 percent of targeted galaxies and quasars (currently
93% of galaxies are assigned high confidence redshifts and 80% of QSOs).</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">E. Target Selection:</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The excellent performance of the spectrographs means that
the spectra of essentially all of the galaxy and quasar candidates have
adequate signal-to-noise ratio in a 45-minute exposure to allow a classification
and redshift measurement. The quasar target selection algorithm has been
demonstrated to meet its goals of selecting 90 percent of known quasars
in the region imaged, allowing a false positive rate of less than 35 percent.
The selection of the Bright Red Galaxy sample is yielding objects in exactly
the redshift and luminosity range targeted, and targeted objects in the
main galaxy sample have the expected redshift range and luminosity function.
An important to-do is to carry out target selection for multiple imaging
scans of a given region of sky, to quantify the reproducibility of the
Photometric Pipeline outputs, and the targeted lists. This is especially
important if we are forced to relax the seeing/image quality requirements.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial">F. Operations:</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;Work is on-going to improve the efficiency of the
observing procedures, especially the switching between imaging and spectroscopic
modes and the time between spectroscopic fields. Software tools are being
written to determine which mode to operate in at any given time, and to
decide which area of sky to observe. The data reduction pipelines operate
within the CPU and memory requirements set out for the survey, and work
is on-going to get the Fermilab production system up to speed. Finally,
Quality Assurance tools are being written to determine the acceptability
of any given chunk of data, both preliminarily on the mountain, and definitively
once the data have been reduced. As of this writing the system is working,
producing data, and reducing it with acceptable speed but the efficiency
must be improved by a factor of several in order to finish the survey within
the allotted time and budget. Most of the factors which reduce efficiency
have been ! identified and in most cases it is clear how to deal with them.
The solution in many cases is simply practice and training, but in others
quite clearly new tools will have to be developed, but there appear to
be no problems of principle.</FONT>
