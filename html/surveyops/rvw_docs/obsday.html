<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Upon first arriving at APO, we locate the day staff and
find out what has been happening to the telescope during the day. This
keeps us informed of what procedural changes may be necessary and gives
us a heads-up as to where to look when/if things go wrong later in the
night.&nbsp; If there is time remaining before the daily phone-con (which
establishes observing priorities for the evening), we will start up the
observing console and scan our email for important items and do some quick
aliveness checks of the various systems. After the phone-con, we continue
our aliveness checks (per a standardized check-list) and go to the telescope
to check out the systems there.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once the telescope is checked out (and the instrument
changed if necessary), we continue in the control room with our standard
checks and email reading. (We typically get between 30-60 emails a day
which can have subjects varying from who is not going to be in today at
the Solar Obs. in Sunspot to new procedures for safe imager handling.)
With no problems, our standard check out system takes about one hour.&nbsp;
Once it is close enough to twilight, we remove the enclosure from the telescope
and do the few remaining setup items we could not accomplish in the enclosure.&nbsp;
We then go back to the control room and start the telescope slewing to
our first field.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>During the night, we have roughly twenty-five (25) windows
we use on the observer console.&nbsp; Here is a highlighted list of some
of them:</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>SOP - Spectrograph Operating Program</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; fSAOImage - guider display for spectrograph
guider</FONT>

<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; skyGang - tells us if we are really pointed/tracking
where we think we are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; PGPlot - updated plot of the active focus
loop</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Murmur - a continuously scrolling window with tons of
useful information,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but
not very easy to catch follow.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Watcher - a program which aims to catch important information
from the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Murmur log and other sources and warn us if something is not right.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Interlocks Display - an interlocks status display from
the Watcher</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>System Status Display - shows telescope position, instrument
specifics, etc.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Servers - controllers that provide the information to
the watcher from the&nbsp; various subsystems</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>TPM Display - real time display of some of the TPM data
(ex. telescope &amp; mirror positions)</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>MCPMenu - controls the telescope from the MCP (position,
flat field</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
screens, calibration lamps, spectrograph slithead clamps, etc.)</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>TCC - Telescope controller: another continuously scrolling
display that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has useful information,
but is sometimes hard to read.&nbsp; Controls</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tracking, pointing, and
focus of telescope and more.</FONT>

the TCC information in a human readable form</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Titrax - time tracking software for observer activities</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Weather:</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; displayweath - an full screen updated display
of current weather conditions&nbsp; (T, dew point, etc.)</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp; wx - an hour-by-hour summary of weather conditions
used in the night log</FONT>

to check for clouds,</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
fronts, etc.&nbsp; (Netscape is also used to check online</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
documentation and obtain other SDSS observing information)</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Editor - for night log</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Email - constantly trying to catch up on the day's email
traffic</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>QA - there are no QA tools at this time</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once we stop observing, we attempt to run the endNight
[SI]OP script which prepares the data tapes and does some other house keeping
routines. This process can often last hours.&nbsp; Once that's started,
we put away the telescope, fill/replace the LN2 dewars as necessary, and
finish the night log. Once endNight successfully completes, we prepare
the tapes for shipping, finish any other details and head home, by this
time, often overlapping with the day staff to exchange information on the
night's work.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Of course, we also should have a description here for
crisis management, but although the need frequently arises, there is no
telling where/when such work will be needed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><B>Efficiency</B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Most of the observing tools we have get the job done,
but few are to the point where they are easy to use, convenient or efficient.&nbsp;
The [SI]OP programs have the ability to write custom scripts inside them,
so that is going to be an efficiency plus once we get beyond the current
round of development and bug-fixing to devote some time to exploiting it.&nbsp;
I want to highlight some other ares of inefficiency - some of which can
be improved easily (and many are being discussed) and others that we are
probably just going to have to live with:</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Spectro inefficiency: high overhead due to diamondPoints,
centering, focusing.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no feedback on whether continued observations will be useful.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(most of this is currently under investigation)</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Imaging inefficiency: having to do multiple lskips.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
the need for endDrift and goDrift between setup and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
imaging runs kills eight minutes each scan.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
variable setup time means sometimes we are starting too</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
early, while other times we miss the desired starting</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
point.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IOP more or less works, but needs to be optimized and made</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
more convenient for the observer.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
endNight MUST work quickly, obviously and reliably.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Night Logs: we log many things which would be better done
automatically.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Telescope enclosure: some engineering/setup tasks we can
do in the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
building; others we can't.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
taking it off during the day heats the telescope up such that</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
we end up spending the first few night hours chasing the</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
seeing as things relax.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
closing the building takes time and can be held up by a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
number of things going wrong. Sooner or later, in an</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
emergency closing situation, we WILL get bitten by this.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Interlocks:&nbsp; an important safeguard, but we often
lose time figuring out which</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
interlock tripped to prevent us from doing our current task.</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The feedback system should be natural and obvious.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Watcher: error messages are often opaque: not necessarily
its fault</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
as it is not always being passed meaningful errors (key problem</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
in most of our software), danger of ignoring them if they are</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
too common or not critical.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Information overload: scrolling murmur and TCC not easy
to use.&nbsp; The Watcher</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
and tccMon help, but do not eliminate this problem.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>QA - we as yet, do not have sufficient tools to monitor
data quality during</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observations.&nbsp; This is
NOT good (and is being worked on, in part).</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>DA - system is much more reliable now, than in the past,
but depending</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on tape drives night after night
can still be a source for data loss. We</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seem to experience higher than
expected "bad" tape rates.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Documentation - there isn't enough. (Ellyne discussed
this in more detail.)</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><B>Staffing</B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Dark runs seem to be averaging around 18 nights. We find
it necessary to interact with the day staff before each observing night,
and due to the endNight process and advantages of meeting again with the
day staff at the end of the night, our "day" is something like 4pm - 8am.
Thus we typically run two shifts a night that are 9-10 hours each.&nbsp;
We need two observers per shift to be able to monitor the above mentioned
myriad of systems as well as to handle the night's problems.&nbsp; This
schedule provides some overlap with the observers in each team during the
shift change, but working a two-shift a night schedule with three observing
teams has proven quite awkward and has resulted in occasional zombie-like
observers.&nbsp; This arrangement requires us to continuously switch from
the first shift to the second shift (and back again) during a run.&nbsp;
It has been shown in many studies that constant shift changes lead to increased
exhaustion rates and employee unhappiness. We can verify this. The current
arrangement is not sustainable over a five-year survey, and data uniformity
could eventually suffer.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition to the scheduled observing run, we have been
needing about three nights at the beginning of the dark run to "shake out"
new bugs in the systems (many of which have changed since the versions
used the previous dark runs) and are talking now about adding an additional
night of testing at the end of each run. This totals, then, about 22 nights
* 4 people/night * 9 hours/person = 792 hours/run.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>At our current staffing level of 6 people working 40 hours/week,
we have an available pool of approx. 960 hours/month.&nbsp; Thus after
the 792 hours observing, we are left with about three (9hr) days of time
available per observer. It is in this remaining three days of time, that
the observer can, a) process what went right/wrong in the last run b) make
improvements to the operating software, instruments, documentation, etc.&nbsp;
c) check and develop quality control and long-term monitoring projects
of data and operating systems, not to mention d) engage in some scientific
research with the data.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Clearly, the hours just aren't there to allow the observers
to take an active role in developing and improving the observing systems
and tools. It is usually the case that the best astronomical instruments
(be they hardware or software) are developed by the people who are actually
going to use them. Despite having the required skill-set to implement the
needed last 10% of systems development, the observers simply do not have
the time to do so.&nbsp; Most astronomers will also agree that the best
data are taken by people who want to use the data and therefore the SDSS
project wisely chose to hire scientists to perform the observations. Scientists
are not likely to be happy if not given the chance to actually do science.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A fourth team of observers would both eliminate the need
to switch shifts as well as allow more time for the activities mentioned
above which are simply falling through the cracks now.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>It is one of our biggest frustrations that we feel we
have the tools and skills to improve our operating environment and contribute
to the scientific output of the SDSS, but do not have the necessary amount
of time to do so. While we realize everyone suffers from a lack of available
time, we believe that given more time, we can greatly benefit the SDSS
and can improve the satisfaction we each derive from our jobs as well.</FONT>
