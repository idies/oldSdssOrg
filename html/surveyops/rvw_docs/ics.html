<H4>Instrument Change System </H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>The instrument change system for the SDSS 2.5m telescope 
  consists of the equipment required to remove and install one of two types of 
  instrumentation on the rotator of the 2.5m telescope. Also included are the 
  storage areas for the instruments and the equipment for handling and 
  transporting the instruments between the storage areas and the telescope.

<H4>Overview </H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>Instruments 1 and 2 are the science instruments for the 
  survey. The engineering camera is diagnostic tool for engineering and 
  maintenance tasks. The instruments mount to the rotator of the telescope at 
  the Cassegrain position via a system of latches. Each instrument is conveyed 
  from its storage area to the telescope via a cart. The instrument lift, 
  located in the telescope fork, is then used to raise or lower the instrument 
  between the cart and the rotator. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Instruments</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>1) Imager: </EM></STRONG>The imaging camera 
  consists of the main body containing the CCDs and their dewars, and the saddle 
  bags which contain the power supplies and the 10 L transfer dewars. The saddle 
  always stays with the camera during normal operations, and is only removed 
  when the camera is serviced. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>2) Spectrograph: </EM></STRONG>The spectrograph 
  bodies are permanently mounted to the rotator. When we talk about changing 
  instruments, we are talking about the cartridges which take the 640 fibers, 
  holding one end of each in position on the focal plane in a plug plate, and 
  route them to one of two slitheads which send the light into the spectrographs 
  themselves. The cartridges require a corrector lens to be installed above the 
  plug plate which is not present when the imager is installed. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>a) Spectrographic Corrector </FONT><FONT size=2><BR>b) 
  Spectrographic Cartridge </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>3) Engineering Camera: </STRONG></EM>A modified 
  spectrographic cartridge without slitheads and containing a CCD camera of the 
  same type used in the spectroscopic guider. It is used to check optical 
  collimation and to acquire pointing model data. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>Instrument Lift: </EM></STRONG>This is a hydraulic 
  lift located at the center of the fork of the telescope. When the telescope is 
  at the zenith and the rotator is in the proper position and an instrument has 
  been rolled into position above the lift, the lift will move the instrument 
  between its cart and its mount position on the rotator. The lift is controlled 
  via a hand paddle near the lift. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Latches: </STRONG></EM>A series of pneumatic 
  latches hold the instruments and accessories on the rotator. They are 
  controlled via a panel on the outside of the mirror cell of the telescope ( 
  OSS ). There are three sets of latches. The first are the three primary 
  instrument latches. They hold the instrument against the kinematic mounts on 
  the rotator. The second are the corrector latches. In spectroscopy mode, they 
  hold the spectroscopic corrector lens in place. In imaging mode they serve as 
  a backup set of latches holding the camera. Each of set of latches are spaced 
  120 degrees apart around the Cassegrain hole in the rotator. The two sets are 
  offset by 60 degrees. Thus there is a latch every 60 degrees around the 
  rotator, and they alternate designation between primary and corrector latch. A 
  third set of latches is used for the imager only. They are called Saddle 
  latches and hold the camera saddle bags. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>Cartridge Cart: </EM></STRONG>The cart is used to 
  transport cartridges between the cartridge rack and the instrument lift. It 
  can hold two cartridges at once. This is for the situation when changing from 
  one cartridge to another. Currently the corrector is also transported using 
  the cartridge cart. The corrector rides on top of a cartridge. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Imager Operations Cart: </STRONG></EM>The cart is 
  used move the imager between the dog house and the instrument lift, and rolls 
  on a set of permanently installed rails. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>Dog House:</EM></STRONG> This enclosure for the 
  imager is located on the rotating portion of the floor which surround the 
  telescope out to a radius of about six feet. The dog house is mounted "behind" 
  the telescope in line with the fork. That is in the same plane that the 
  altitude axis moves in, but on the opposite side of the fork from the 
  secondary truss. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2><STRONG><EM>Cartridge Rack:</EM></STRONG> This is a nine bay 
  hydraulic rack which is accessed through a garage door in the Support 
  Building. There are three levels which can each hold up to three cartridges. 
  The rack stops in one of three positions so that each level can be accessed by 
  the manipulator to remove or replace cartridges. </FONT></P>
  <P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT size=2><EM><STRONG>Cartridge Manipulator: 
  </STRONG></EM>The manipulator is used to transfer cartridges between the rack 
  and the cart. It picks up the cartridge by a couple of handles mounted on the 
  outside of the cartridge body, above its center of gravity. When retrieving a 
  cartridge it raises one slightly off the rack, is then swung out so that the 
  cartridge is suspended above the cart. The manipulator then lowers the 
  cartridge onto the cart. This is all controlled by a deadman switch in the 
  manipulator handle. It is up to the operator to guide the cartridge and 
  initiate raising and lowering. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Current Status</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>The instrument change system is fully functional. It is 
  capable of mounting, dismounting, and storing all of the instruments. It is 
  not however, completely finished. Currently instruments are mounted and 
  dismounted in manual mode. By the summer there will be an automatic mode in 
  which the Motion Control Processor ( MCP ) will monitor and restrict actions 
  through the interlocks system. This will be the normal mode of operation 
  during instrument change. When implemented it will increase operational 
  efficiency, and definitely increase the safety of the instrument change 
  process. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>The spectrographic corrector handling and storage will change 
  significantly over the next couple of months. Currently the corrector is 
  transported, installed, and removed from the telescope on top of a cartridge. 
  It is stored in the cartridge rack, and has a special fixture to allow it to 
  be handled with the manipulator. This is a time consuming and somewhat nerve 
  racking process. The plan is to construct a special cart which is used to 
  install and remove the corrector. When not in use, the corrector will be 
  stored in its cart in an enclosure mounted to the north side of the 2.5m 
  enclosure. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>There a couple of maintenance issues which should be raised 
  here. First, this is a complicated system and requires several hardware and 
  software subsystems to work in concert. Thus modifications to any of the 
  systems involved must be considered very carefully before changes are made. 
  The software is handled through a version control system called CVS. Hardware 
  modifications are made through the Change Control Board. These facilities must 
  be used and combined with extensive testing to prevent interruptions to 
  operations due to unforeseen consequences of changes. </FONT></P>
  <P style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT size=2>The state of the telescope and 
  instrument change system is conveyed to the interlock logic through a large 
  number of switches and sensors. It is a vital maintenance issue that these 
  switches and sensors remain in proper adjustment and working order, so that 
  incidents of false or misleading signals sent to the system are minimized. 
  There isn't a much more frustrating experience than being kept from doing 
  something because the interlock system is being fed incorrect or misleading 
  information ( the only thing worse is having the system act improperly when 
  given correct input ). </FONT></P><FONT size=2></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
