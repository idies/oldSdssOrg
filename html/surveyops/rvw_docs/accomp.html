<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The big news this quarter is the resumption of data taking
after the re-installation and testing of the repaired secondary mirror.
Data taking was resumed in February, and several exciting science results
were obtained from analysis of the imaging data from the February and March
dark runs. This is a tribute both to the performance of the repaired telescope
and the fast data processing turnaround. In the first quarter of 2000,
the SDSS acquired imaging of 500 square degrees and 10,000 spectra. Many
of the results below were presented and discussed at the SDSS project’s
biannual Collaboration meeting, held in Seattle in March 2000.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Large Scale Structure</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Graduate students Ryan Scranton, Dave Woods (Chicago),
Rita Kim and Hiranya Peiris (Princeton) have analyzed the angular cross-correlation
function between galaxies and (color-selected) quasars. They find a signal
indicative of weak lensing of the quasar population by the large-scale
structure of the foreground galaxies. Attempts to normalize the signal
using the correlation function of galactic stars revealed the presence
of wide binaries in the Galactic stellar distribution, an interesting result
in its own right.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Scranton, Woods, Dave Johnston, Andy Connolly (Pittsburgh)
and Istvan Szapudi (Durham) have been measuring the angular correlation
function of galaxies as a function of magnitude, as well as higher-order
statistics. They have shown that systematic effects in these statistics
are at an impressively small level for galaxies brighter than r'=21.5,
and are preparing a series of papers describing their results.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Quasars</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>New high redshift quasars have been found, including a
quasar at z = 5.82, the highest redshift object known. This quasar was
found by its colors in the March 2000 imaging data by Xiaohui Fan and Michael
Strauss (Princeton) and the spectrum measured at the Keck 10 m telescope.
The absorption from the Ly-alpha forest is very strong, but residual flux
remains blueward of Ly-alpha emission, implying that this redshift is still
below the epoch of reionization. Wei Zheng and Zlatan Tsvetanov (JHU) have
found three quasars with redshifts in excess of z = 4.7, including an object
at z = 5.3. SDSS has now discovered two dozen quasars with redshifts greater
than 4.5 and more than 120 with redshifts greater than 3.6.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Fan is completing analysis of the evolution of the quasar
luminosity function from z = 3.5 to z = 5. He finds results consistent
with conventional wisdom (although with substantially smaller error bars);
the number density of quasars drops dramatically over this redshift range.
Several papers on this subject are in preparation.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There are roughly 1000 quasars confirmed spectroscopically
thus far from the SDSS spectroscopic survey, making it one of the largest
such samples yet. Dan vanden Berk (FNAL) has used these data to make a
composite average quasar spectrum, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 100
per resolution element. Many faint lines of extremely high ionization elements
(up to Fe X) are visible, which will be very useful for constraining models
of the central engine.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Clusters of Galaxies</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Rita Kim (Princeton), Marc Postman (STScI), Jim Annis
(FNAL), Bob Nichol (Carnegie Mellon) and others are carrying out detailed
comparisons between cluster catalogs found from the SDSS data using a variety
of different methods. A promising new technique, developed by Annis, defines
a cluster as a Brightest Cluster Galaxy plus a population of red elliptical
galaxies. Finding the ridgeline of ellipticals in a color-magnitude diagram
allows an accurate determination of what is essentially a photometric redshift.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Galaxies</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>David Hogg (IAS), Vijay Narayan and Iskra Strateva (Princeton),
in collaboration with Masataka Fukugita and Naoki Yasuda (JPG) have completed
an analysis of the bright galaxy counts, from r'=12 to r' = 21 on a common,
CCD-based system. The results are consistent with a power law, which calls
into doubt recent suggestions that the local galaxy distribution exhibits
a hole.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Mariangela Bernardi (UC) and Scott Burles (FNAL) have
developed code to measure the velocity dispersion of galaxies from their
spectra. They used these results to determine the fundamental plane of
elliptical galaxies, based on over 1000 objects. The scatter in the resulting
distance indicator is comparable to or better than the best results in
the literature; moreover, they are able to determine the fundamental plane
in four bands simultaneously.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Michael Blanton (Fermilab) shows that the galaxy luminosity
function found by SDSS gives a luminosity density for the Universe about
a factor of two higher than previous estimates - this is due to the more
complete galaxy fluxes (Petrosian rather than isophotal magnitudes) measured
by SDSS. He is studying the dependence of the luminosity function on galaxy
type, size, and color.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Tim McKay, Phil Fischer (U. Michigan), and collaborators
are continuing their analysis of weak lensing of background galaxies by
foreground galaxies, and thus constraining the mass profiles of these galaxies.
They are finding that elliptical galaxies show substantially stronger shear;
they are more massive by roughly a factor of three. They are measuring
the shear around clusters, and are finding a strong effect. Finally, they
are beginning to measure the ellipticity of the mass profiles of galaxies;
initial results are that these are consistent with the light profiles.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Carbon Stars</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The SDSS has spectroscopically identified four faint high
latitude carbon stars, two of which at least are high proper motion dwarfs.
Matching of SDSS and 2MASS data (from the new 2MASS data release) has produced
a further 10 candidates.</FONT>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>RR Lyrae and A Stars</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;Two papers on the structure of the Galactic halo
have been accepted by the journals. They show complex structure on the
halo, including the presence of recognizable tidal remnants, which manifest
themselves as clumps in the distribution of stars. One of these studies
is based on A stars (Heidi Newberg, RPI, and Brian Yanny, FNAL). The other
is based on identifying RR Lyrae stars using their variability on overlap
scans (Zeljko Ivezic, undergraduate students Josh Goldston and Kristian
Finlator, and Jill Knapp Princeton). Light curves for ten of these stars
have been obtained by Bing Chen (JHU) and Kevin Krisciunas and Beth Willman
(University of Washington); they have confirmed that they are indeed RR
Lyraes.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Brown Dwarfs</FONT></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The last gap in the spectral sequence from O stars to
planets is well on the way to being filled in. Three very red objects discovered
in the imaging data from February were observed at UKIRT in March and proved
to be the so-called transition objects between spectral types L and T,
with methane bands of increasing strength. These objects are brown dwarfs
with masses somewhere in the 20 - 50 Jupiter mass range, and the spectra
of these and other methane dwarfs tell us what the planets recently discovered
around nearby stars are likely to look like. SDSS has by far the best potential
of any current or planned project for delineating the details of the brown
dwarf spectra sequence and other properties. This work was done by Jill
Knapp, Xiaohui Fan, undergraduate Alex McDaniel (Princeton), Dave Golimowski
and Todd Henry (JHU), in collaboration with Sandy Leggett (UKIRT) and Tom
Geballe (Gemini).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;SDSS has obtained imaging data of the SIRTF quick
look fields. These data will be reduced by SDSS and made available to the
US community through the SIRTF science center.</FONT>
