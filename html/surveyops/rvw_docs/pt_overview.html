  <P><FONT size=-1>The telescope is a commercial 20-inch Cassegrain reflector

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Instrumentation 
  includes a six-position filter wheel, rotating
sector shutter, flat field projector, Soric flat field screen, and
a thinned AR-coated SITe 2048x2048 CCD similar to those in the SDSS camera
and spectrograph detectors. The CCD is cooled with a mechanical refrigerator
(an APD CryoTiger) and controlled by electronics similar to those
on the SDSS imager and spectrographs. .</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Commands to the 
  CCD, telescope, and filter/shutter controller are sent from the unix-based 
  observer's program ("MOP") to a terminal server in the dome. Each device is 
  attached to a different port on the terminal server. CCD imaging data are 
  returned via fiber optic directly to the custom data
acquisition system. The observing procedure is ordinary all-sky broad band photometry. The
standard star candidates (we have not yet declared a standard system) are mostly high
quality non-variables from Landolt's UBVRI lists. System magnitudes will be tied to spectrophotometry
of fundamental stars.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Functional Status</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>The system is functional.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The observer's software picks standard stars, moves the
telescope, and gathers data. During the night, the observer selects the
photometric transfer fields, monitors the sky, and checks for focus or
other problems. At the beginning and end of the night the observer obtains
calibration data (flats and biases) and opens or closes the dome.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Data are stored on a Unix (SGI Irix) computer until the end
of the night when they're written to tape and shipped to Fermilab for processing.

<B>Performance</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT SIZE=-1>The system collects survey-quality data.&nbsp;
Known deficiencies against survey requirements are:</FONT> 
  <P><FONT size=-1>1. Observing efficiency is below the requisite one 
  calibration set (four pointings) per hour primarily because too much time is 
  needed for standard stars. The remedy will be to use sub-array readouts for 
  the standards, reducing the readout time overhead. The observing system (MOP) 
  has already been modified but the data reduction system (MTPIPE) needs to 
  accept the new data format. This is a deeper problem than one might expect 
  because the standard star identifications currently require position 
  confirmation from many surrounding stars (a legacy from the old 24-inch 
  telescope, which didn't point very well). We are developing single-star 
  identification procedures based on the known pointing accuracy of the 20-inch.

      2. Transfer fields are currently selected by the
observer based on projected 2.5 m observing plans. Since routine observing does
not allow full-time observers, we are implementing a system (database) that the observing
software (MOP) will query to build a night's observing plan.</FONT>
  <P><FONT size=2>3. We are using a preliminary u'g'r'i'z' calibration based on 
  USNO 40-inch observations and it will be a few months before we will have an 
  "official" system declaration. </FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=2>4. The staffing requirements are not known. We currently have 
  a crew of non-APO observers (two JHU postdocs and a LANL scientist) dedicated 
  to the telescope while it's in use. Within a year these observers will hand 
  over their duties to SDSS observing staff. Although the 20-inch probably 
  requires only 1/2-time attention while observing it's not obvious that frees 
  up 1/2-time for other work if the other work cannot be interrupted so the 
  staffing requirement is not known. This problem will be explored this summer 
  and fall when existing APO staff will be trained to take photometry data while 
  the 2.5 m is operating.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>Long-term Robustness</STRONG> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=-1>We expect existing equipment to last the duration
of the survey. It might be desirable to upgrade some items in the data
acquisition system (especially as spare parts become scarce) but there
is no fundamental reason to change.</FONT> 
  <P><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential problems:</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=-1>1) The dome temperature can be high in the summer. 
  Controlling the heat will improve early evening seeing and reduce suspected 
  problems with lubricants and sealants at high temperatures. Adding dome 
  insulation and running the ventilation fan is probably a good idea. 
</FONT></P>
  <P><FONT size=-1>2) Winter cold causes problems with the closed cycle 
  refrigerator, namely it may refuse to restart after a power failure. We plan 
  to install an uninterruptable power supply and also explore ways to warm the 
  appropriate parts. </FONT></P>
