<P>The construction phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is complete,
the testing phase is nearly complete, and commissioning operations have
been underway for some time. Science quality data has been obtained from
the commissioning operations, analyzed, and published. The Survey is now
making the transition from commissioning to routine operations. This transition
is not complete and there is much to be done as we shift our focus from
building and testing equipment to making the equipment reliable and efficient.
At the same time, we are building a scientific staff, which will bring
to fruition the goals that we established a decade ago. These goals were
to image about 10,000 square degrees of the Northern Galactic Cap; to select
from those images a million objects, primarily galaxies and quasars; to
obtain spectra of those objects; and to create a catalog of those images
and spectra, first for the astronomers from the participating institutions
and then for the astronomy community-at-large.

<P>We are planning two reviews of the Survey in order to help us set our
course for the next five years. The first review, which will be held at
Apache Point, from April 25 to 27, will examine whether the Observing Systems
and the Observatory Support will be able to sustain the five years of observing
and produce the quality of data that is needed to achieve our scientific
objectives. The second review will be held at Fermilab, the site of the
SDSS data processing and distribution, prior to the end of July. In that
review we will ask the reviewers to examine whether the data processing
operations can process the data in a timely manner and effectively distribute
it to the collaboration and then the astronomy community at large in accordance
with our distribution plan developed in cooperation with the National Science
Foundation.

<P>The specific charge for the review of the Observing Systems and Observatory
support is contained in three sets of questions, which we would like this
Committee to answer:
<UL>
<LI>
Will the Observing Systems, with the proposed improvements, be ready to
support the five-year survey? Will they, as you find them on April 25,
be sufficient to achieve our scientific goals?</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Has the observing staff been prepared to support a five-year survey? In
particular has the SDSS Management given them the tools and training to
carry out the survey? Is the size of the observing staff sufficient to
support a five-year survey?</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Does the project have sufficient technical personnel at APO and the participating
institutions to support the maintenance and continuous improvement of efficiency
and reliability? Given the geographic dispersion of people will our management
plan work?</LI>
</UL>
