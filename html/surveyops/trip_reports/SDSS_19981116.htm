<P>The following work was completed this week on the 2.5-meter telescope
interlock system.&nbsp; This report was prepared by John Anderson.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>PLC Power Supply</FONT></B>
<BR>The power supply for the interlock PLC was replaced with a larger supply.
The new power supply is run off the 110 vac UPS in the interlock rack.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>PLC Input and Output Modules</FONT></B>
<BR>The I/O modules for the interlock PLC were replaced with 32 bit I/O
modules. This was done to increase the number of available inputs for the
interlock system.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Lightning Protection</FONT></B>
<BR>A lightning surge suppresser was added to the altitude junction box
on the remote I/O link to the rotator junction box.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Building-in-place Switch</FONT></B>
<BR>A new switch was mounted and wired to detect the building in place
over the telescope.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Altitude Motion Interlock Change</FONT></B>
<BR>A new interlock was installed to allow for altitude motion inside the
building. With the building in place switch, the windscreen and telescope
are allowed to move up to 18.5 degrees. This should help in stowing the
telescope inside the building. Currently this is implemented as a soft
interlock only. Steve Bastian will modify the Altitude interlock switch
enclosure to add an additional switch. The new switch will be added to
the low level interlocks in January.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Building Clear Switch</FONT></B>
<BR>A rail was added to detect the entire safe range of the building off
the telescope.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Telescope Azimuth Alignment Clamp</FONT></B>
<BR>We were able to work out with Charlie Briegel the interface problems
between the interlock system and the MCP. We were able to activate the
clamp under MCP control and read the status correctly.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Telescope Fiducial System Cables</FONT></B>
<BR>Fiducial and bar code reader cables were pulled for the azimuth and
altitude axis fiducial systems. The cables will need to be terminated at
a later trip.

<P>A new cable track was mounted inside the cone area of the telescope
to support the fiducial and bar code cables. More track will need to be
ordered and installed at a later date.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Splitter Chassis Bypasses</FONT></B>
<BR>With the above interlock modifications, I believe there is no need
for any splitter chassis interlocks to be bypassed. The only exception
may be the hatch doors.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Altitude and Azimuth Interlock Tests</FONT></B>
<BR>All altitude and azimuth, soft and hard interlock were tested and found
to function correctly. The rotator interlocks will be tested in January
after the new rotator is installed. A report on the interlocks tested and
their activation points will follow next week.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Spectrograph Slithead Control Boxes</FONT></B>
<BR>Glenn, Alan Uomoto, and Steve Bastian worked out the mounting scheme
for the spectrograph slithead door control boxes. Steve will begin mounting
the boxes when he has time.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Azimuth Amplifier #1 Failure</FONT></B>
<BR>The azimuth amplifier #1 voltage comparator board failed this week.
This is the same problem identified on October 29, 1998 with IC1 failing.
We replaced the board with a board from the spare Alt/Az amplifier. All
seems to be working correctly.

<P>The board in the spare Alt/Az amplifier has been repaired and modified
with transient supressors across the Glentek +/- 15 vdc power supply lines
and a series resistor to IC1. If the azimuth amplifier fails again, replace
the board with the modified board.
