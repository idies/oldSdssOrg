<P>This report summarizes work done at Apache Point Observatory (APO) by
Charlie Briegel, Steve Bastian, Bob Nagle, Jon Davis, and Bill Boroski
during the week of November 10-13, 1998.

<P>Bob Nagle worked with us this week at APO.&nbsp; Bob is a retired telescope
engineer with over 20 years of experience with telescope control systems.&nbsp;
We shared with him data on the servo measurements we've made in the past
and spent quite a bit of time discussing the present state of the telescope
control system.&nbsp; Bob feels that we're getting close but appreciates
that there's still quite a bit of work to be done.&nbsp; Bob concurs with
our decision to replace the rotator harmonic drive with a direct-drive
system.&nbsp; He also shares our concerns with the azimuth drive bearing.&nbsp;
More on this later.&nbsp; We'll continue to stay in touch with Bob and
will share any tracking data we collect in the coming dark run.

<P>Charlie made a number of measurements on the altitude and azimuth axes.&nbsp;
In altitude, we are tracking with error rates of +/- 5 counts at velocities
ranging from 10 cts/sec to 10,000 cts/sec.&nbsp; In azimuth, the picture
is not so good.&nbsp; We continue to struggle with tracking at very low
velocities.&nbsp; At velocites above 300 counts/sec, we can achieve tracking
error rates of +/- 5 counts.&nbsp; However, at a velocity of 10 cts/sec,
the position error rapidly increases until the integral term saturates
and the servo falls out of closed loop.&nbsp; We suspect that this problem
is related to friction in the azimuth drive bearing.

<P>French recently looked at the azimuth drive bearing and noted that two-thirds
of the cylindrical rollers in the bearing had been removed.&nbsp; He also
noted that the remaining rollers were half-submerged in a bath of gear
lube.&nbsp; In researching this further, we have learned that gear lube
is not the most suitable lubricant for this application.&nbsp; Rather,
a high-performance, low-temperature bearing grease is preferred.&nbsp;
So before making additional azimuth drive measurements, we agreed to replace
the lubricant in the azimuth bearing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Jon Davis, Bob, Steve, and I lifted the dust cover off the azimuth
drive bearing.&nbsp; The gear lube was easily visible and had the appearance
of clean motor oil.&nbsp; However, it was very sticky to the touch with
an extremely low viscocity.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we removed the drain plugs,
nothing came out.&nbsp; By working allen wrenches into the drain plug openings,
we were able to extract a very thick, very dirty bearing grease. Jon said
this appeared to be the grease that was originally in the bearing, before
the gear lube was added.&nbsp; After several minutes of extracting the
grease in this manner, the gear lube finally started to ooze from the openings.&nbsp;
Its flow rate was comparable to molasses in winter, so we gathered some
space heaters and placed them in the lower cone pit to warm the telescope
body.&nbsp; Over the course of the day, the telescope warmed slightly and
the flow rate increased.&nbsp; After approximately 12 hours, the level
of the gear lube was below the bearing rollers.&nbsp; We replaced the drain
plugs and the dust cover for the night to keep the bearing clean and moth-free,
and then opened things up the following morning.&nbsp; We continued with
the heaters until virtually no fluid was exiting the drain holes.&nbsp;
I should note that there is still a rather thick, sticky film of this lubricant
on all of the bearing surfaces that is of concern to all here.&nbsp; We
plan to wipe off as much of this film as possible before installing the
new grease.

<P>Our original intent was to replace the gear lube with the bearing grease
that Jon has been using on the 3.5-meter telescope bearings, since he has
had good cold weather experience with it.&nbsp; However, before doing this
we looked at the L&amp;F drawing for the azimuth bearing assembly and saw
that they had specified a synthetic bearing grease.&nbsp; Jon obtained
a spec sheet from the vendor and noted that the grease has better properties
than the grease being used on the 3.5-m.&nbsp; The grease is spec'd to
-100 deg. F and is applicable for low RPM applications involving moderate
to heavy loads. Jon has ordered a case of this grease and it is expected
to arrive on Friday. It will be installed in the azimuth bearing on Friday
afternoon and then Charlie will repeat the azimuth servo measurements.

<P>Charlie continues to work on the interface between the TCC and MCP and
has been in contact with Russell Owen to discuss some of the problems he
is having.&nbsp; There appears to be a rounding problem between the two
systems that results in an accumulated position error.&nbsp; Charlie is
focusing his effort on fixing this problem.

<P>Now for the good news.&nbsp; We managed to fix the latest wind baffle
altitude oscillation problem.&nbsp; By turning on the altitude motor brake
and pulling and pushing at the end of the wind baffle, we noticed that
the main drive gear was moving back and forth by a few degrees.&nbsp; The
drive chain at this point was very tight.&nbsp; Bob, Steve, and I removed
the chain and disassembled the motor/planetary gear assembly and found
that all of the bolts securing the planetary gear spline were loose.&nbsp;
Steve Bastian cleaned the bolts and bolt holes with acetone and&nbsp; then
applied Loctite to the bolt threads and reassembled the motor.&nbsp; After
remounting the motor, we installed the drive chain following the procedure
on the L&amp;F windbaffle assembly drawing.&nbsp; The chain is taught,
but not as tight as it has been.&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved the telescope in
altitude inside of the building at a velocity of 10,000 counts/sec and
noted no oscillation in the wind baffle.&nbsp; We also hung from the end
of the wind baffle and could not make the wind baffle budge.&nbsp; The
control loop held position quite well.&nbsp; We then opened the enclosure
and ran the telescope up and down twice in altitude at velocities of 200,000
counts/sec.&nbsp; Again, we observed no oscillations in the wind baffle.
Needless to say, we were very happy to find and fix this problem.

<P>The bar code scanners for the alt/az fiducials have arrived, so Steve
and I installed one of the scanners on the azimuth drive and tested it
with one of the fiducial bar code labels.&nbsp; The scanner worked quite
well.&nbsp; We also worked out the design of the mounting brackets for
the azimuth and altitude tape encoder readheads.&nbsp; Steve will work
on these brackets; our objective is to install the fiducial systems, the
bar code labels, and the altitude bar code scanner during the week of Dec
8.

<P>Glenn Federwitz had sent with me revised logic diagrams showing the
recent changes made to the interlock system (stop buttons, etc).&nbsp;
These diagrams have been placed in the interlocks binder at APO;&nbsp;
the binder now reflects the current state of the system.

<P>We would like to make special note of all of the help and support we
were given by Jon, Dan, Gretchen, Madonna, Mark, and the rest of the APO
staff.&nbsp; As always, everyone was great in helping us with our work.&nbsp;
We also want to thank Bob Nagle for all of us help with the azimuth bearing,
the windbaffle altitude drive, and for all of his input and advice.
