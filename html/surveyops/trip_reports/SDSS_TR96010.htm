<P>SUMMARY</P>

<P>Several frequency sweeps of the azimuth and the altitude drives 
for the 2.5m telescope were taken. The data appears to be reasonable. An
attempt at measuring azimuth friction appears also to give reasonable
results. Attempts were also made to measure wind disturbance. No useful
information has come from the wind measurements so far. We were unable
to make measurements on the rotator drive.</P>

<P>INTRODUCTION</P>

<P>Before making any measurements, it was necessary to
clean the surfaces of the azimuth drive disks, since an in situ grinding
of the rotator disk had taken place the previous week. It was also
necessary to finish the installation of the counter weights since the
telescope needed to be balanced. With instructions and help from Jon
Davis, Angela Prosapio was able to wriggle into the rather cramped area
of the azimuth disk and remove the motor oil preservative and any
grinding dust embedded in it and replace it with a thin layer of WD 40
(A very thin oil). In order to clean the area directly under the drive
capstans, it was necessary to rotate the structure 30 degrees or so.
With instructions by remote control from Charlie Hull in Seattle, the
wind screen was rotated along with the telescope. The drives were
cleaned up by Friday afternoon. It also appeared that we could get a
little more azimuthal motion between the telescope and the wind screen
if the wind screen floor plates were moved back a bit from the
telescope. This did in fact give us about a third more motion.</P>

<P>THE GOALS</P>

<P>We started with this list more or less in order of priority:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Frequency sweeps of the azimuth drive at four different altitude
   positions with both velocity and acceleration records. 
<LI>At least one frequency sweep of the altitude drive. 
<LI>An attempt to measure friction of at least one axis. 
<LI>An attempt to measure wind disturbance. 
<LI>Get some time domain records of the system response. 
</ol>

<P>MEASUREMENT SETUP</P>

<P>The instruments used were an HP 3563A system analyzer to produce the drive
waveform and record the response in either the time or frequency domain,
a Wilcox accelerometer with a magnetic base for acceleration, (I didn't
realize until I saw the data sheet that this device has a velocity mode
as well) a Kepco bipolar power amplifier to drive the servo motors in
voltage mode, a Tektronix current probe for measuring motor current, and
a gain of 20 instrumentation amplifier for the tachometer signal. There
was a Kollmorgen tachometer installed on the drive shaft of one azimuth
motor. The tachometer was specified as generating five volts/rad/sec.
The reason for driving the motors in voltage mode is the thought that
perhaps the telescope would have less tendency to wander during the
sweeps because of the damping effect of driving with a low impedance.
Torque is the input parameter of interest however, hence the use of the
current probe. A laptop PC was used to extract the data from the HP
analyzer onto disk.</P>

<P>FIRST MEASUREMENTS</P>

<P>The biggest worry for me was the possibility of the structure 
slowly wandering during the sweep. This turned out in practice not to be
the case. It was apparent after first driving the azimuth that the
constraints at right angles to the azimuth preload springs were loose,
allowing the azimuth motors to rock back and forth. It turned out that
the majority of the bolts holding the constraints in place were loose.
After going around and tightening four sets of bolts the motor swaying
ceased. The structure was very stable and a sweep could be run for an
arbitrary length of time. I chose a sweep resolution setting of 133
points/decade which took about 10 minutes to run to completion. At the
maximum output voltage of the power supply (43 volts pk) the excursion of
the telescope would hit the wind screen at a frequency lower than about
0.2 Hz. This frequency is above the corner frequency of the structure.
By 0.2 Hz the phase is already -90 degrees. I choose a three decade span
from 0.2 to 200Hz for the frequency sweeps. We set up a pointer made
from a gas welding rod an attached it to the end of the structure and
taped a ruler to the floor to give us an idea of the telescope position
during the sweeps. By Friday evening, we had two or three sweeps,
including a one hour run just to check on the degree of fine structure
of the plot. Examining the data later that evening, it looked odd. There
seemed insufficient attenuation of the magnitude plot at higher
frequencies.</P>

<P>On Saturday morning, I checked the setup, and the tach amplifier 
output had a large offset (200mV). I had no ground reference with very
high impedance inputs, and the tachometer has essentially infinite
impedance to ground. The CMOS input leakage of the amplifier would over
a period of minutes charge up the windings and associated wiring of the
tach, resulting in many volts of common mode voltage. One 100K resistor
from each input leg of the amplifier to ground cured the problem. There
was now about 2mV of offset at the tach amplifier output. We then ran
the azimuth sweeps again and the results now looked much more
believable. We also did sweeps with only one motor (the one on which the
tach was not mounted) to see if there were any magnetic coupling effects
between the motor and the tach (there appear to be none).</P>

<P>Saturday during the day the weather was marginal, and Jon Davis was 
uncomfortable with the idea of uncovering the building. We did azimuth
sweeps at 0 and about 25 degrees within the building. We also did an
accelerometer run at 0 degrees. It is evident the accelerometer in
velocity mode has 0.5Hz corner frequency. Since we had done most of the
sweeps we could inside the building, I tried to measure the friction.
The azimuth was driven with a very low frequency sine (39 mHz) at a
voltage just enough to break the static friction. I first tried 10 mHz,
but when break away occurred, the telescope motion was too large and it
hit the wind screen. After 2 or three attempts at 39 mHz we got a record
free of windscreen collisions. The record is in the time domain and
contains a tach voltage record. On Saturday evening the weather cleared
and we attempted to move the building, but I was intimidated by the
Klaxon and decided to wait until Sunday. I plotted the magnitude data
for a few sweeps Saturday night, and they looked much better than those
from Friday.</P>

<P>On Sunday morning Charlie Hull showed us how to move the 
building. In the course of the morning we did azimuth sweeps at 90, 60,
and 45 degrees of altitude. I noticed during the course of moving the
telescope around what appeared to be a pronounced torsional resonance of
the secondary weight disk. To check it we mounted the accelerometer to
the disc tangential to the edge. The torsional resonance of about 9Hz
clearly showed up when the telescope was driven in azimuth at 90, 60 and
45 degrees.</P>

<P>At this point I decided it was time to move the tach from
the azimuth to the altitude axis. Jon Davis crawled into the nether
azimuthal regions and removed the tach from the altitude. While trying
to remove the bearing preload plate from one altitude drive, the drive
disk slipped. Jon checked the slip torque with a torque wrench and it
read 20 lb ft. If we assume a drive disk diameter of 4" and a
coefficient of friction of 0.1 the implication is that that altitude
drive has about 600# of preload. Jon was able to get the tach mounted,
although he noted the apparent strength of the permanent magnet was much
less than when he had first mounted it a year ago. Now any regrets about
missed azimuth measurements were by definition passed. The first
altitude measurement was a sweep with velocimeter mounted on the
secondary. There was no torsional resonance evident when the altitude
axis was driven. We had time to do tach and accelerometer sweeps of the
altitude at 0 degrees.</P>
 
<P>Sharon Lackey arrived Sunday night at explained that she would be 
unable to complete much of her planned work, so that we could have
access to the telescope for much of Monday. This then was gravy day. The
weather was very fine, but unfortunately for us almost windless. Our
first sweep was an altitude run at 90 degrees. We spent the rest of the
day trying to get some wind disturbance data with marginal success.
Runs were taken in the time domain with a 5Hz dithering signal sent to
the servos to break the static friction. For many of the runs the
voltage to the motors was 150 mV which is clearly not enough to break
static friction. This small amount of drive was visible both in the
accelerometer mounted at the end of the structure and the tach. The
implication the dither is coupled through the compliance of the
structure. By late Monday we had decided to call a halt and took down
the equipment, replaced the rotator floor and put the building back.
Angela and I packed the instruments back into their boxes in preparation
for shipping them back to Fermilab.</P>

<P>CONCLUSIONS</P> 

<OL>
<LI>The primary resonance of the structure in azimuth is close to its
predicted values. 

<LI>The primary resonance of the altitude is lower than the azimuth for
unknown reasons 

<LI>The secondary support torsional resonance is close to its predicted value 

<LI>The preload on at least one altitude drive is very low. What effect on
the structural response this may have is for me unknown.
</ol>

<P>FUTURE GOALS</P>

<OL>
<LI>Link the measurement data with the data from the finite element analysis going on at Fermilab 

<LI>Measure the friction multiple times to get some statistics. 

<LI>Come again when there is more wind, ideally with the wind screen in
place to try and get better wind disturbance data 

<LI>Check to see what effect (if any) the preloads have on the
   response of the structure.
