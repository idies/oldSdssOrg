<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Azimuth Fiducial Alignment</FONT></B>

<P>Fiducial blocks 1-7 were aligned then all 24 fiducials were tested by
checking to see if the MCP received the 200ns interrupt pulse. We found
that block number 15 and 16 did not interrupt the MCP so we realigned 16
but could not get 15 to work.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rotator Read Heads</FONT></B>

<P>Read Heads #1 , 2 &amp; 3 were aligned and tested by connecting each
one to the MEI and running the rotator around in closed loop. Each one
was then connected to Claudio’s fiducial board and checked to see if the
interrupt pulse to the MEI board was there when a reference mark was passed.
We did not check to see if every reference mark around the rotator produced
an interrupt.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rotator Limit Switches</FONT></B>

<P>The rotator 280 and 290 degree CW and CCW limit switches were checked
to make sure they were operating properly. We found that the direction
switch was backwards which made it trip on the wrong accuator. We also
noticed that the bidirectional hard limit would trip the amplifier a couple
of times and did not find the reason.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rotator J.B. Cables</FONT></B>

<P>The serial cable and the power cable for the rotator J.B. were shortened
to connect to the header plate, and 8-pin Burndy’s were installed because
the hole in the header plate was drilled for 8-pin instead of 4-pin Burndy’s.
The wrap cables also had the 8-pin Burndy’s installed.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Interlock Display</FONT></B>

<P>The interlock display was checked and we found that Charlie needed to
broadcast a new interlock packet because some of the bits had changed and
new ones were added. The display was changed so that the whole display
could be seen on the monitor in the lower level of the telescope (it runs
at 1024 x 768). Craig thought that it should be optimized for that resolution
so it could also be seen on some of the laptops. More work has to be done
with the logic ladder to get it working properly.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Junction Box for Primary Mirror Temp Sensors</FONT></B>

<P>A location for the J.B. was discussed with Dan and it looks like the
best spot would be the back of the PSS by the dog house. Talked to Steve
about mounting it there so the next time out we could start installing
the new Flex I/O modules.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Slip Detection Encoder</FONT></B>

<P>The slip detection encoder for the rotator motor was wired up to the
Burndy on the encoder housing so Steve could mount the encoder.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Azimuth Stow Switch</FONT></B>

<P>The Front(East) azimuth stow switch was stuck in the compressed position
which caused the stow light to come on twice 6 degrees apart. The switch
was removed and a burr was removed and a lubricant was added. It was then
remounted but not aligned. Correct alignment of the stow switch must still
be checked.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Rotator Interpolators</FONT></B>

<P>Removed the 4 Interpolators for therotator and checked the switch settings which were S1-S3, S5, S8 off, S4, S6, S7 on.  Reinstalled them back into the PSS.
