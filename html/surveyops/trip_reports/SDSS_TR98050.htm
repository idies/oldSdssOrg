This report focuses on the alignment of the wind baffle azimuth drive motors
and the installation of the wind baffle cam follower assemblies.&nbsp;
Details of the telescope and wind baffle survey work are described in a
separate trip report prepared by Terry Sager.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>INTRODUCTION</FONT></B>

<P>The team working on these tasks included Steve Bastian, Jon Davis, Angela
Prosapio, Terry Sager, Chuck Wilson, and Bill Boroski. Terry Sager is the
head of the Alignment Group at Fermilab. Chuck Wilson is a member of this
group.

<P>Tuesday was primarily a travel day. Chuck, Terry, and Bill arrived at
APO in the late afternoon and spent the remainder of Tuesday getting settled
in and getting Chuck and Terry acquainted with the telescope and wind baffle
assemblies. Angie had a later flight into El Paso, so she arrived at the
site on Wednesday morning.

<P>As the wind baffle and secondary truss were removed from the telescope,
we were able to do all of our work inside the enclosure. This was beneficial
since it rained throughout our visit.&nbsp; It should be noted that all
measurements in this document refer to mechanical axis positions. No efforts
were made to correlate the mechanical axis positions with optical axis
positions.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>INITIAL ALTITUDE AXIS MEASUREMENTS</FONT></B>

<P>Our plan was to re-align the wind baffle azimuth drive motors at the
same time that we installed the cam followers.&nbsp; Aligning the drive
motors included radial re-positioning to align the drive wheel axis with
the center of rotation of the wind baffle rotating platform, and vertical
re-positioning to make the wind baffle altitude axis coaxial with the telescope
altitude axis.&nbsp; We used an alignment fixture to accomplish the radial
alignment.&nbsp; To determine the amount of vertical shimming required,
we used surveying techniques to determine the plane of the wind baffle
altitude axis with respect to the plane of the telescope axis.

<P>In order to establish the position of the telescope altitude axis, we
needed a target at the center of the rotating portion of the altitude bearing.
After reviewing various telescope drawings, we determined that the only
way to access this was from the inside of the primary mirror cell. Jon,
Angie, and Bill carefully removed all of the plywood mirror covers and
those sections of the primary mirror retaining ring and perimeter seal
near both altitude bearings. Terry was then able to reach into the altitude
bearing and string monofilament fishing line around the bolts to form an
X near the center of each bearing. By aligning survey scopes at each end
of the altitude axis, one could look through the bore of the wind baffle
altitude axis and watch the movement of the fishing line cross-hair as
the telescope was rotated. We noted that the crosshairs moved off-axis
by 0.008". Since our measurement accuracy was +/- 0.010", we defined the
string crosshairs as the centers of the telescope altitude bearings. We
did not remove these strings after completing our alignment work.&nbsp;
They were left in place for possible future use.

<P>It was much easier to establish the center point of the windbaffle altitude
bearings. The bore through the windbaffle bearings has an inside diameter
of 1 inch. Chuck had brought along 1" o.d. bushings that accepted survey
targets at their centers. Thus, all we had to do was insert a bushing into
the wind baffle bore, then insert the survey target into the bushing. With
these targets in place, we again rotated the telescope/windbaffle assembly
in altitude and watched the change in position of the survey targets. As
with the telescope axis, the movement of each target was within the accuracy
of our measurements and so we defined these targets as the center of the
wind baffle altitude axis at each fork.

<P>We subsequently proceeded to measure the plane of both the telescope
and wind baffle altitude axes with respect to gravity by measuring the
elevation of the center targets over each of the wind baffle azimuth drive
motors. We used the wind baffle manual control box to move the wind baffle
in azimuth until the altitude axis was positioned over one of the windbaffle
azimuth drive motors. We then manually centered the telescope within the
wind baffle by pushing on the telescope fork. The elevation of the telescope
and wind baffle altitude bearings was measured and then the assembly rotated
to the next drive motor. This sequence was repeated for each of the drive
motors. Table 1 shows the results of the initial elevation measurements.

<P>The distance between the telescope altitude axis targets was 111.5".
Given the average elevation change of 0.041" from the north to south fork,
the telescope altitude axis is 0.021 degrees off of perpendicular with
respect to the azimuth axis.

<P>The distance between the wind baffle axis targets was 179". This dimension
was obtained from telescope drawings. Given the average elevation change
of 0.216", the wind baffle altitude axis was 0.069 degrees off of perpendicular
with respect to the azimuth axis.

<P>Since the slope of the wind baffle altitude axis was always from the
north to the south fork, and since the magnitude of the slope at each motor
location was constant within the accuracy of our measurements, the measurements
indicated that the wind baffle azimuth motors did not have to be shimmed
in elevation. We noted that the wind baffle altitude bearings are located
in pillow blocks that are bolted to the top of the wind baffle fork. By
shimming under the block on the south fork, we felt we would be able to
bring the wind baffle altitude axis parallel to the telescope altitude
axis.&nbsp;&nbsp; We decided to do this after we installed the wind baffle
azimuth guide rollers and re-aligned the azimuth drive motors.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>MOTOR ALIGNMENT AND WIND BAFFLE GUIDE ROLLER INSTALLATION</FONT></B>

<P>During the process of installing the guide rollers, we also moved the
drive wheel flanges away from the drive disk and realigned the azimuth
drive motors radially and horizontally. We worked on one motor assembly
at a time. We started by placing dial indicators on the bottom of the drive
disk to verify that the adjustments did not change the wind baffle floor
elevation. We used two dial indicators for this purpose. We placed the
indicators approximately four feet away on either side of the drive motor.
With the indicators zeroed, we used a hydraulic ram to lift the wind baffle
platform off of the drive roller. The ram was placed between the concrete
pier and an appropriate box beam on the floor structure. We tried to get
as near to the motor as possible, and only lifted the floor assembly high
enough to see light between the drive roller and drive surface. We subsequently
loosened the four mounting bolts that held the motor in place and adjusted
the radial alignment bolts to move the motor towards the telescope center
until we had a gap of approximately 0.375" between the roller flange and
drive disk. We then installed the alignment bracket designed to align the
motor radially with respect to the drive disk inner radius. The alignment
bracket was also designed to set the final spacing between the roller flange
and drive disk at 0.375 inches.

<P>With the alignment bracket in place, we slowly adjusted the radial alignment
bolts on the motor housing until the tooling balls on the alignment bracket
contacted the inner radius of the drive disk. At this point, we tightened
the mounting bolts and snugged all four radial alignment bolts, then rechecked
the tooling balls to make sure we were still in proper contact with the
drive ring.

<P>We then slowly lowered the rotating platform back onto the drive wheel,
checking the dial indicators to make sure elevation hadn't changed. For
all three motors, the largest elevation shift seen was 0.003". We also
sighted along the bottom of the drive disk across the drive roller to make
sure the drive disk was sitting flat on the roller. On Az Motor 1 and Az
Motor 2, no light was seen passing between roller and disk. On Az Motor
3, there was slightly more light passing between the roller and the drive
disk near the flanged side of the roller.&nbsp; We used shim stock to check
the height of the gap, which we determined to be &lt;0.001". With such
a small gap, we did not change the angle of the motor mount.

<P>Once the motor assembly was properly aligned and bolted in place, we
raised a guide roller assembly into position and clamped the assembly to
the drive motor, as shown in Figure 1.

<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Figure 1</B>. Wind baffle guide roller clamped in place on a

<P>&nbsp;

<P>We used a 0.010" thick piece of shim stock to set the spacing between
the guide roller wheel and the drive disk inner radius, and adjusted the
angle of the roller assembly to make sure we had full contact between the
roller and disk. With the assembly properly positioned, we transfer-punched
the mounting hole locations onto the drive motor housing. The guide roller
assembly was removed from the motor housing and the mounting holes drilled
and tapped.

<P>The first guide roller assembly, mounted onto Az Motor 3, was installed
with no problem. We ran into clearance problems when we tried to install
the roller assemblies onto motors 1 and 2. As shown in Figure 2, there
is a step above the machined drive surface that was left behind after the
drive disk radius was machined. The top of the roller assembly bracket
was hitting this step at motor locations 1 and 2. Angie measured the width
of this step around the drive disk and found that the width varied from
0.100" to 280". One of the thinner spots just happened to be near Az Motor
3, which is why it went on with no problem .

<CENTER><B>Figure 2</B>. Interference between the guide roller bracket
and drive disk step.</CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P>To provide adequate clearance between the guide roller brackets and
the drive ring, we modified all three bracket assemblies by removing 0.300"
of stock from the bracket area adjacent to the interference. Once modified,
all three guide roller assemblies were installed without further difficulty.&nbsp;
Many thanks to Steve Bastian and Jon Davis for making these modifications
quickly.

<P>As the roller assemblies were being installed, Steve also filed away
a large burr that had developed on the inner edge of the drive disk due
to previous contact with the drive wheel flanges. We were concerned that
this burr would cause premature wear on the guide roller surfaces and wanted
to remove it before rotating the wind baffle across the guide rollers.

<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER><B>Figure 3</B>. Guide roller assembly mounted onto Az Motor #3.</CENTER>
&nbsp;

<P>After all three assemblies were installed as shown in Figure 3, we tested
the operation of the guide rollers by rotating the telescope assembly in
azimuth. Because we were still working inside of the enclosure, we were
only able to rotate approximately 210 degrees. Chuck, Steve, and Bill each
positioned themselves near one of the motor assemblies, while Angie drove
the wind baffle using the manual control box. We noted that the rollers
turned with no effort when in contact with the drive disk. We also noted
that the disk assembly was usually in contact with two of the three rollers,
but not always in contact with the same two. This suggested that the assembly
was not always trying to drive itself off axis in the same direction. We
also noted a couple of occasions in which the gap between the drive disk
and one of the drive rollers would become quite large. We measured these
gaps; the largest gap was 0.048" and occurred between the # 2 motor roller
and drive disk when the dog house was over that motor location. While we
were rotating, we also watched the alignment of the drive and guide rollers
with respect to the drive disk surfaces. We noted that the drive disk surfaces
are not flat and perpendicular. The angle of contact between the rollers
and drive disk would vary slightly as the assembly was rotated. There were
no trends or tendencies, nor were the gaps ever very large. We measured
the largest gap we saw; it turned out to be &lt;0.0015".

<P>With the installation and testing of the guide rollers and motor alignment
complete, we proceeded upstairs to re-check the alignment and shim the
windbaffle assembly.

<P>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>WIND BAFFLE SHIMMING</FONT></B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>We positioned the telescope assembly so that the altitude axis was oriented
east and west, with the dog house to the south, and re-measured the elevation
of the telescope and wind baffle altitude axes.&nbsp; This orientation
positioned both wind baffle pillow blocks under the overhead crane in the
telescope enclosure.&nbsp; The initial measurements are shown in Figure
4.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="image8Q5.JPG" HEIGHT=251 WIDTH=480></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Figure 4</B>. Elevation measurements after wind baffle</CENTER>

<CENTER>motor alignment but before shimming.</CENTER>


<P>&nbsp;

<P>From these measurements, the slope of the telescope altitude axis is
1.61 x 10<SUP>-4</SUP> in/in.&nbsp; Extrapolating this slope to the position
of the wind baffle targets, the elevation at the north target should be
107.125 and the elevation of the south target should be 107.088. Since
the north elevation was off by 0.005", no adjustment was needed. However,
since the south elevation was low by 0.185", we decided to add a shim between
the wind baffle fork and altitude bearing housing to raise the bearing
center to the proper elevation.

<P>We loosened the bolts securing the wind baffle assembly to the support
fork and used the overhead crane to lift the south end of the wind baffle
frame assembly.&nbsp; While the bolts were loose, we shifted the pillow
blocks so the bolt washers fit properly into their respective counterbored
holes.&nbsp; We slipped a shim pack, which actually measured 0.190", between
the fork and bearing housing and lowered the frame. We also measured the
radial alignment between the wind baffle and telescope and adjusted the
wind baffle frame horizontally until the two axes were aligned to within
.030" from end to end.&nbsp; After tightening down the wind baffle pillow
blocks, we sighted on the wind baffle targets and re-measured elevation.&nbsp;
Final elevation measurements are shown in Figure 5.

<BR>&nbsp;
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;CONCLUSION</FONT></B>
<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>
The wind baffle azimuth drive motors have been aligned radially with the
wind baffle rotating platform.&nbsp; The drive motors are also properly
positioned in elevation such that the telescope and wind baffle altitude
axes are coaxial within the tolerances of these measurements.

<P>Guide rollers have been installed on the wind baffle azimuth motor housings
to keep the rotating floor centered on its axis.&nbsp; The rollers are
positioned to keep the drive disk at least 0.375" away from the flanges
on the azimuth drive wheels.&nbsp; The guide rollers are bolted in place
but not pinned.&nbsp; Once the telescope assembly has been exercised in
azimuth and the roller mount locations determined to be adequate, the mounting
brackets should be pinned to the motor housings to maintain their position.
