<p><u>SUMMARY</u></P>


<p>Friction data was recorded for the altitude, rotator and azimuth axes of the 2.5m
telescope. Additionally, frequency sweeps of the azimuth
and the altitude drives with current mode drive were taken, however 
we were not able to do a frequency sweep of the rotator due to drive capstan slippage. 
At sidereal rates, the azimuth axis torque/velocity relation has a 
negative slope.

<p><u>INTRODUCTION</U></P>

<p>This is the second measurement trip to APO. The first, last 
October, was an attempt to characterize the dynamics of the structure.
We believe we know the location in the frequency domain (if not the
associated phases and magnitudes) of the principle resonances of the
altitude and azimuth axes. We were unable to move the rotator in
October, so we had no dynamic data on this axis. A goal for this set
of measurements was to run a sweep of the rotator axis.</P>

<p>During this trip, the condition of the telescope was: secondary truss 
removed and primary mirror support pointing at the zenith, without dummy
instrument weights or dummy mirror weights. The bottom heavy condition
of the structure limited motion in the altitude axis to about 2 degrees
of arc. </P>

<p><U>THE GOALS</U></P>

</OL>

<p><U>MEASUREMENT SETUP</U></P>

<p>The instruments used were an HP 3563A system analyzer to produce 
the drive waveforms and record the responses in either the time or
frequency domain, a Kepco bipolar power voltage amplifier to drive the
servo motors, a home built set of op-amps used to convert the Kepco to
current mode, a home built position interpolator that could be attached
to the Heidenhain encoders for transmitting position and differentiated
position data via RS-232 at an 8Hz rate, a 0.1 ohm shunt for measuring
motor current, and a gain of 3 instrumentation amplifier for the
tachometer signal. For those measurements that required recording data from
two channels simultaneously, we used an HP54512 digital scope. There was
a Inland Motor tachometer installed on the drive shaft of one altitude
motor. A laptop PC was used to extract the data from the HP analyzer and
scope onto disk. Claudio brought a zip drive that contained the Matlab
software package that allowed him to do a cursory examination of the data
while still on site. As it turned out, our time was so short that we
were taking measurements late into the evening and so had very
little time to analyze data. One additional day would have been very
useful. </P>

<p><U>MEASUREMENTS</U></P>

<p>After spending the morning unpacking our instruments and 
trundling them down to the 2.5m enclosure, the first order of business
for Tuesday afternoon was to check the velocity voltage relation (Kv) of
the Inland Motor tach generator, since all of our measurements used
velocity. The tachometer was specified as generating 2.5 volts/rad/sec,
but in fact produced about 0.3 volts/rad/sec for our October
measurements. Based on conversations with Inland Motor, Charlie Hull
decided that replacing the existing steel mounting fixture with one made
of a non-magnetic material would allow the tach to produce its specified
output. The checking method used was to move the altitude axis by hand
and collect a record of position and tach output voltage. Integrating
the tach signal should be related to the position by Kv. We were at
first misled by data from the analyzer which was scaled in a strange
way. Channel 1 applied a -0.6 scale factor to its input, while channel 2
applied a -1 scale factor to its data. Later, Claudio noticed
anomalously large offsets on the HP scope as well. We believe this was
due to the freezing temperatures in the 2.5m enclosure, but we will see
if normal operation is restored when we get our instruments shipped back
from APO and run them at room temperature. </P>

<p>Wednesday morning, after realizing that the data was strangely 
scaled, we took new data and applied the appropriate factors and the
numbers began to appear somewhat more plausible. After these missteps,
we arrived at a measured Kv of 2.59 volts/rad/sec.</P>

<p>Wednesday afternoon was taken up with connecting power to the
altitude motors. The first powered measurement was a frequency sweep of
the altitude axis from 0.1 to 100 Hz. Even without the truss, there were
several resonances evident.</P>

<p>The next step was to install a feedback loop around the Kepco to 
convert it to current mode. We decided to use the Kepco instead of the
GlenTek because the Kepco has a ground referenced output. This allowed
us to use a shunt resistor to measure current instead of a current
probe, a device which is prone to drifting (the offsets of our
instruments rendered the point moot). By looking at the response to a
square wave, it was evident the system had a high impedance output and a
response time that implied a bandwidth of about 1KHz, ample for any of
the measurements we had in mind. We now took another sweep of the
altitude to compare voltage and current mode drive, and there were no
obvious differences. This implies that the measurements taken in October
in voltage mode would have looked the same had they been done with
current mode drive.</P>

<p>We were ready to begin friction data, but had a readout routine 
for our scope that would only take 500 points out of a possible 8000 and
store them on disk. Claudio obtained some example scope data collection
files from Fermilab, but we had neglected to bring the scope programming
manual with us. From these, after some hours of fiddling Wednesday night
and Thursday morning, we had a routine to read 8000 points from two
scope channels into two files.</P>

<p>By midday Thursday, we began the attempt to do the static 
friction measurement of the altitude axis. We were unsuccessful due to
the restoring force of the out of balance structure and resorted to
driving the system first with sinusoidal, then triangular current
profiles. From these data runs, it was evident the altitude axis stores
very little energy when breaking static friction and makes the
transition from being stationary to moving in a well behaved fashion.
After making several runs during the afternoon, with help from Jon
Davis, we remounted the dummy instrument weights in preparation for
making rotator axis measurements in the evening.</P>

<p>Charlie Hull had wired in a GlenTek driver with a tachometer 
feedback to run the rotator in closed loop in velocity. In order to
"break in" the drive surfaces, we ran the rotator for several
revolutions before taking any data. The friction in the rotator is very
high - the highest of the three axes. We removed the GlenTek and
attached the Kepco in order to run in current mode. In
velocity mode, a frequency sweep would cause the torque to rise at 20dB
per decade, whereas in current mode the input torque is constant with
respect to frequency. We drove the rotator drive at a level
approximately 20% higher than the value required to overcome static
friction. The sweep began at 0.1Hz and the initial indicators were that
the phase information was meaningless, since the friction was so
dominant. By the time the frequency reached 1Hz, the drive began
slipping, so we immediately shut off power and gave up on getting a
sweep. We re-attached the GlenTek and took a measurement of the torque
required to hold a constant velocity as a function of angular position
through a 90 deg. arc. There was a torque variation of about 25% which
is consistent with the data taken in November by Jon Davis.</P>

<p>On Friday morning, Charlie Hull moved the tachometer from the
altitude to the azimuth axis. At the same time we were attaching a
linear potentiometer between the wind screen platform and the fork of
the telescope in order to attempt to servo the wind screen to the
telescope. Steve Bastian had made a clamp and pivot arrangement for us
ahead of time. Where Steve had put in a hole for pivoting, Jon Davis
milled a slot to allow the pot slide to sweep from side to side as well
as to pivot. This arrangement worked and we were able to sweep the
azimuth through a wide arc. At this point, we took a bode plot in
current mode and to our surprise, the plot looked very similar to 
those taken in October, in spite of the absence of the secondary
truss. That afternoon, Steve Hudson helped us take the dummy instrument
weights off the rotator.</P>

<p>Meanwhile, Peter Prieto and Jeff Simmons were hooking up a 
Heidenhain encoder interpolator to go between the azimuth encoder and
the MEI servo controller installed in the VME crate below the azimuth
drive. Charlie Briegel at Fermilab was able to establish remote contact
with the MEI and observe axis motion. During the afternoon and evening,
several time domain records with various drive waveforms were taken.
Finally, in the evening, closing the velocity loop, constant velocity
points at low speed (0.3 x sidereal was the slowest) were taken to try
and see in what portion of the friction curve the axis was operating. It
is clear that, at a velocity below 3-5x sidereal, the slope of the
torque/velocity curve is negative (Striebek effect).</P>

<p>By 9:30 PM Friday, we had decided to call a halt and took down
the equipment, policed the interior of the 2.5m building and lugged the
instruments back to the main building. With help from Peter and Jeff
we packed the instruments back into their boxes in preparation for 
shipping them back to Fermilab and were done by about 10:30. </P>
