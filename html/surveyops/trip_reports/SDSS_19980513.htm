<BR>On this trip I concentrated on the continued commissioning of the Windscreen
Servo System. The new Altitude motor (with brake) was installed and wired.
The brake control was implemented and tested. The Windscreen altitude brake
is applied whenever <U>both</U> directional inhibits are asserted. This
is the only mode that makes sense since if only one inhibit is asserted
(at zenith for example) the windscreen must still be able to move off the
limit. The E-Stop generates a bi-directional inhibit and thus asserts the
brake.

<P>I took an additional look at the noise being picked up on the LVDT’s
for both Azimuth and Altitude and found that there was a ground loop through
the iso-buffer that was inducing the noise. I removed the buffer and went
directly to the ADC of the PLC. This change brought the operational noise
down to a few hundred counts or less with all servos on. This appears to
be an acceptable level.

<P>The altitude loop gain was set for the proportional part of the PID
loop. Additional tuning will be needed for the I and D terms when the actual
windscreen is installed and wind loading and other structural resonance’s
can be explored. Based on what I observed I believe the servo system will
be "stiff" enough to meet the tolerances at the telescope truss.

<P>One operational difficulty that will have to be addressed is the functioning
of the telescope servo amplifier interlocks. The interlock for the bi-directional
inhibit require someone press the reset on the front of the amplifier.
I have spoken to Peter Prieto and he knows of the problem and has a new
interlock PAL to install.

<P>On departing the site, the windscreen system was operational in both
Azimuth and Altitude and had tracked the telescope motion for over twelve
hours while work on the telescope servo system progressed. A small amount
of my time was spent on other miscellaneous system issues.
