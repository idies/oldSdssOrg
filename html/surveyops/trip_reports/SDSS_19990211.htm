<P>On 2/11/99, I took two of the rotator encoder read-heads to the Heidenhain
office in Schaumburg, IL, to verify that the ERA 880C read-heads were functioning
properly and to understand why we were having such a difficult time aligning
these heads to the rotator tape.&nbsp; I worked with Rick Glos (VP-Sales),
Tom Wyatt (Area Sales Manager), and Dan Braasch (Service Supervisor) to
check the strength of the reference pulse signals and to understand how
head misalignment affects the performance of the encoder.

<P>Dan put one of the readheads on a bench setup and took about 30 seconds
to align the head and get good output signals from both the counting track
and the reference pulse.&nbsp; However, upon closer inspection Dan noted
that while the crossing point for the reference signal was within spec,
it was higher than he thought it should have been under ideal bench conditions.&nbsp;
Ideally, the crossing point should be at zero when looking at the reference
pulse signal on an analog oscilloscope.&nbsp; If the reference pulse signal
looks like a "greater than" sign (>), then the crossing point is the apex
of the V.&nbsp; If the reference signal is looser and looks more like a
figure eight (8), then the crossing point is where the lines cross in the
middle.&nbsp; In either case, we were seeing this crossing point at about
0.15V on the scope.&nbsp; There is an internal pot on the readhead that
adjusts the reference signal bias voltage, so Dan adjusted this pot until
the reference signal crossing point was at zero.&nbsp; Dan commented that
while 0.15V is within the calibration specification, starting out with
a bias this high may eat up some of the misalignment tolerance of the head.&nbsp;
Thus, if the mechanical alignment was a little out, we might see a signal
on the scope that wouldn't be adequate enough to fire the reference indicator
on the Heidenhain PWM-8 phase meter.&nbsp; This is exactly what we were
seeing at APO on Feb 4-5.

<P>We installed the second readhead on the bench and found that the reference
pulse crossing point was also set at 0.15V, so Dan adjusted the bias voltage
on this head as well.&nbsp; Since all five of the heads we purchased were
from the same lot, Dan says it's likely they were all calibrated on the
same bench and are all likely to behave the same way.&nbsp; Although Dan
showed me how to adjust the reference pulse bias voltage, he agreed to
recalibrate the remaining three read-heads for us, so I will return them
to him after we install and test the two heads he just calibrated.&nbsp;
Calibrating them in-situ on the telescope will be too difficult given the
location of the readheads.

<P>We also played with angular misalignment and found that if the face
of the head is not parallel with the face of the tape, then the magnitude
of the reference signal varies.&nbsp; If the head is tipped such that the
top of the head is farther from the tape than the bottom, the magnitude
of the reference pulse decreases.&nbsp;&nbsp; When Scott Smith of Heidenhain
was with me at APO, he noted that the amplitude of the reference pulse
was smaller than it should have been. This suggests that our tape may not
be perpendicular to the read-head mounting surface and that we may have
to shim the head to adjust the angle.&nbsp; We also need to check the radial
run-out of the tape along the top and&nbsp; bottom edges to make sure we
don't have any wobble in the tape.&nbsp; If the tape pitches in and out,
then we may occassionally miss reference marks due to the angular misalignment
with the head.

<P>Finally, we measured the vertical position of the head with respect
to the tape when the head and tape were "ideally" aligned.&nbsp; The distance
from the top of the head to the top edge of the tape was 0.685".&nbsp;&nbsp;
We can use this dimension to determine the ideal thickness of the shim
beneath the head mounting brackets.&nbsp; We also played with the vertical
misalignment tolerance
<BR>and found that we could move the head approximately +/-.030" without
compromising the output signals.

<P>Once the revised telescope engineering schedule is worked out, I will
schedule a trip to APO to install and align the two heads that have been
re-calibrated.&nbsp; If we're successful with the alignment, then I will
return the remaining three heads to Heidenhain for recalibration.

<P>I want to note that Rick Glos, Tom Wyatt, and Dan Braasch at Heidenhain
were all extremely helpful and supportive in identifying the source of
our problems and in providing a solution that I'm confident will work.&nbsp;
I also want to acknowledge the help given to me by Scott Smith last week
at APO.
