<P>The trip was ok, we collected data and learned some things. There are several
things I would like to discuss. Let me first to describe the
trip and then we can talk about future actions.</P>

<P>On Wednesday, Angie Prosapio and I hooked up the amplifier and tachometer on
the altitude axis and I took a lot of data.  At night, very late, we saw some numbers
that we did not like.  On Thursday morning we found a moth squeezed on the altitude
drive.  After we cleaned the drive, numbers looked more reasonable.</P>

<P>On Thursday morning, I took more data from the altitude axis.  During the
afternoon, Angie and I connected all the stuff to the rotator.  We took all the
data necessary and left the system ready for some closed-loop tests
in position.</P>

<P>On Friday, with Charlie at APO, we moved the rotator and he read the encoder
with the MEI. All the pieces worked OK.   During the afternoon we
set and tuned the PID loop. In general it works OK.  We found that the program
for tuning the parameters of PID is not enough; we have to do something
better. The other problem is due to the coupling of the Harmonic
Drive.  The motor shaft has an oscillatory response.  You can not see the
oscillations on the encoder on the instrument rotator, but by using the tachometer
included with the reduction it is possible to see an oscillatory
response.  I'd like to feedback that signal to the controller either through the
MEI or the summing node at the input of the Glentek Box.  To do this requires running 
an extra shielded cable from the motor drive to the MEI
or Glentek rack.  I talked a little with Angie and Paul Czarapata about this.
I'll talk with Paul in more detail later.  I wanted to play a
little more with my parameters in the computer but I 
had some problems with my simulation.  It is a new homework, but we know
that for Phase 1A or 1B the rotator can be moved and parked at some
position using the MEI controller.</P>

<P>On Saturday, we started working on Azimuth with Sten Hansen while Angie and Charlie
worked on the instrument lift. (I think this is the first time the
schedule on the telescope overlapped between two groups!!!)  We spent
almost all morning troubleshooting the noise induced on the tach.  At some point
we decided to take some measurements with noise and then filter them out.
The azimuth has almost twice as much friction as we recorded in January,
and now the friction is symmetric, which is a good news.  We also found
that if someone was walking on the wind screen or on the building floor, the
vibration was coupled to the telescope (the velocity signal from the tach.
was showing noise in low frequency). Sten double-checked the coupling
between the wind-screen and the telescope and we finally found that Carl
Lindenmeyer put four tabs made of stainless steel on the telescope fork.  These
tabs span the gap between the fork and the wind-screen.  They allow
the instrument cart to move easily between the wind-screen and the fork.
One of them was touching the wind screen floor and coupling the vibrations
between both parts.  We bent the tab up with a screwdriver and now you can jump on
the wind-screen and not cause any output on the tach. signal. We lost
one morning chasing down this problem, but we now know how sensitive the 
telescope is. After fixing the vibration problem, we took some additional drive data 
and redid some of our earlier measurements.  Finally, we packed up our equipment.</P>

<P>I have discussed the tab problem with Carl and he is considering using
another material for the tabs, or using another scheme. It is not a big deal.
He raised a good question about what will happen when people start putting
more stuff on the telescope and a lot of wire and hoses will couple the
telescope with the building.  The only thing I can say is that the control
loop will reject only the low frequency vibration (up to 1Hz if we are optimists).
The rest will be coupled in the same way the tab coupled the
vibrations.  We should monitor this every month 
with the encoder or the tachometer to verify whether the coupling is increasing as more cables
are installed.  In this way, we can check for solutions or
improvements to reduce the coupling.  Carl told me that French wants to seal
the gap between the telescope and the wind-screen with 'something'.
He should know about this problem and if he installs a seal, it
will be prudent for us measure the coupling after installation.</P>
