<p><u>APO Work Summary</u></P>
<OL type="1">
<LI>Telescope motion tests
	<OL type="a">
      <LI>Moved rotator with VME-PC via offset and PID

      <LI>We thought we had found some good coefficients for the PID loop, but could not reproduce 
	  	good motion after breaking for a cup of coffee.  It appeared as if the friction in the 
		drive had changed.

      <LI>Drove rotator with VME-MCP via offset and PID, but PID 
               oscillated.  Smoked Sten's power amplifier before I could dampen the
               rotator oscillations with different coefficients.  Smoked the amp
               by trying to turn it off with the electrical strip...
               cycled the power.
       <LI>Sten and Claudio made some good measurements on all three axes.

<LI>Instrument Lift
	<OL type="a">
       <LI>Tested motion similar to FNAL test with additions such as 
               backoff from out of tolerance force.
       <LI>Noticed VME crate power off causes all outputs to go active...
               result of active low logic.
       <LI>Ron Miksa believes the lift requires a minimal amount of weight from
               the base weight to enable motion with hand held.  noticed
               no manual control due to strain gage reading low.  Let the
               unit rest a day and then was able to move it manually.
       <LI>ADC ground is evidently not the same as the separate ground wire
               run to the DIO.
	</OL>
	 <BR><BR>	 
<LI>NBS pulse installed on new IP DID48 accurate to 14 usecs which is the 
       resolution of the signal, &plusmn;9V square wave.  Currently interrupting
       on level twice per second, but ignoring low level interrupt.
	 <BR><BR>	   
<LI>I think it was a productive trip.  As soon as Peter Pietro's Glen-Tek amplifiers are installed,
       I'll be looking for another opportunity for testing at APO.  This trip provided feedback
       for what is needed for monitoring and diagnostics for telescope
       motion.  Also, on the way home, I visited the Very Large Array (VLA) to make 
	   a contact and obtain information.
