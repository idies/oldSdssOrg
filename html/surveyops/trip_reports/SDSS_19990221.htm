<P>Denton Morris and Pat Colestock were successful
in repairing the mapper software, as all the problems were related to
the system upgrade which was done a few months ago.  They returned to
System 7.5 (from 8.1), and everything was OK.  It turns out we may have
a long-term problem here, as there is no C-development software that is
compatible with System 8.0 or later.  That is, they have stopped making
the tools that we would need to upgrade our software for later systems.
That means we MUST remain on System 7.5 to make the mappper work.  They have
informed Craig Loomis of this fact, and he will maintain the older system
for the time being.  But it will be harder and harder to maintain this old
system as time goes on.  So a switch to new software may be required in
the not-too-distant future.  (all this is a disadvantage, possibly, that
comes from using the MAC platform which has gone through so many changes
in recent years).</P>

<p>They also upgraded the fiber correlator software to the lastest version
including automatic alignment algorithms, and added an output file
template that is approximately what was requested in published file
specs.  Perhaps most importantly, they met with Adrian Pope and 
explained the system to him.  He appeared familiar with and capable of
maintaining the mapper software in the future.  Since he will be involved
with taking data, it appears that he is a good match for taking on that responsi-
bility.  Copies of the software will also be maintained at Fermilab for
backup and further development.  --  Neither Denton nor Pat think they will
need to return to APO if Adrian takes over the maintenance of the soft-
ware.</p>

<p>They suggested that Carl Lindenmeyer have a look at the right hand
illuminator.  It appears to be loose in its mount.  It is spring loaded,
but considerably looser than the lefthand side.  Perhaps someone has bumped
the assembly.  Otherwise everything seemed to be OK.</p>
