<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">The Review Board is extremely
impressed with the work that has gone into the development of the pipelines
to date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; The advanced level
of the Photometric Pipeline and its readiness for transition into operational
mode is particularly noted from the preliminary scientific analysis that
have been carried out on the photometric data (i.e. color-color plots).<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
The current state of the Imaging Pipeline is particularly advanced, and
that test data from the telescope was able to be run through the pipeline
with essentially no problems is very encouraging and a testament to the
readiness of the system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; It
is recognized that other aspects of the pipeline, such as the spectroscopy
portion, lags behind in development consistent with the schedule of delivery
of the instruments.

hiring of a Survey Operations Director.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
A widely distributed project such as the SDSS very much needs direction
from a single person who is directly responsible for monitoring the survey
schedule and budget.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; He or
she must be able to make critical decisions, in the context of the main
Scientific Requirements of the Survey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
Having a single director will also allow expedient arbitration in the event
that critical decisions must be made and there are conflicting opinions
among the Science Team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; The
Board hopes that the partner institutions agree to cede the authority to
the Operations Director to carry out these tasks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

board strongly urges the completion and adoption of a well-defined set
of Science Requirements for the Survey.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
It is absolutely essential to have such Requirements to provide engineering
and scientific “targets” for hardware and software development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
The Requirements should allow formation of metrics against which to judge
progress of the survey, and to form the basis for critical Science Team
decisions.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; Achievement
of the Science Requirements provides the context for most decisions in
the Survey.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">Basically yes.&nbsp; The
one processing effort that has probably been underestimated is in the area
of quality assurance.&nbsp; The SDSS data comes from several different
instruments and will be fairly complex, requiring an appropriate set of
automated and human support quality review tools.

<br>&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">The general feeling among
the Board is that the staffing plan is marginally adequate.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes"></span>&nbsp;
As a baseline, we note that the data processing staffing estimates are
comparable in number of FTEs to that of the 2MASS effort.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
However, the SDSS data processing task is inherently more complex, involving
three completely different pipelines dealing with data from three very
different instruments.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes"></span>&nbsp;
One advantage the SDSS effort has is that considerable software development
is being supplied by the partner institutions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">The board feels that the
needs for Quality Assurance in particular have been seriously underestimated.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
Experience with the 2MASS pipeline operations indicates that this is a
time-intensive process that benefits from human intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
The need to identify unforeseen problems in the data as quickly as possible,
having either a hardware or software origin, is very strong especially
early in the survey.</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">- The Board suggests that
the Project consider making more use of skilled non-Ph.D. personnel for
tasks that do not require scientific judgements.&nbsp; This can include
pipeline operators, integration testing and repetitive data analysis.
<br>&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">However, there are key tasks
that require judgements having ramifications in the validity of the resulting&nbsp;
science products that require trained a trained scientist.&nbsp; It is
also recognized that Ph.D. astronomers and physicists bring considerable
"value added" benefits to the project.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt"><![if !supportEmptyParas]><![endif]><o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="tab-stops:22.5pt">- The Board is somewhat concerned
with the operational plan that requires the intervention of a scientist
at each intermediate step of the pipeline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
This makes the processing rate and efficiency strongly dependent on the
availability and schedule of the scientists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
It is recognized that this configuration will be necessary at the beginning
of operations, but the Project should consider moving toward a more “hands-off”
pipeline system if it is deemed possible after some experience with operations
has been had.<span

the project consider moving quickly to a full end-to-end test of the processing
system as soon as possible during the test year operations.<span 



style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
The test should include everything from shipping tapes from the observatory,
processing, quality assurance, loading into the archive, and feedback to
the observatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes"></span>&nbsp; Such a
test should be repeated as often as necessary during the test year to optimize
the pipeline operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp; Tests
of the Imaging, Calibration, and Spectroscopic pipelines can be performed
separately.

the project decide soon if the Imaging phase of the survey can begin soon,
and if it is possible to live with a ~1 year delay in the start of the
Spectroscopic phase of the survey.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>&nbsp;
