<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The construction phase 
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is complete and the commissioning phase is 
essentially complete. Commissioning operations were resumed in February after 
completing the repair of the secondary mirror. Science quality data has been 
obtained from the commissioning operations, analyzed, and published. The Survey 
began the transition from commissioning to routine operations in late April. 
While this transition is not complete, we have achieved a reasonable 
approximation of routine operations at the Apache Point Observatory since March. 
Nevertheless, there is much to be done as the project staff shifts its focus 
from building and testing equipment and software to making the equipment and 
software reliable and efficient.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our primary goal is to 
improve the efficiency of our operations at the mountain so that we can approach 
our original goals in five years of observing. These original goals were to 
image about 10,000 square degrees of the Northern Galactic Cap; to select from 
those images a million objects, primarily galaxies and quasars and to obtain 
spectra of those objects; and to create a catalog of those images and spectra, 
first for the astronomers from the participating institutions and then for the 
astronomy community-at-large. These goals have been scaled back by about 25% to 
make them realistic for a survey of five years duration beginning April 1, 
2000.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two reviews of the 
Survey were planned in order to help the SDSS management set its course for the 
next five years. The first review, which was held at Apache Point from April 25 
to 27, assessed the state of the Observing Systems and the Observatory Support. 
The committee was asked to determine whether these systems were ready to begin 
the five year of observation period and whether they were capable of producing 
the quality of data that is needed to achieve our scientific objectives. The 
committee's report for the first review will be posted on the SDSS web site 
prior to the second review. The second review will be held at Fermilab on July 
20-21, the site of the SDSS data processing and distribution.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want this committee 
to examine whether the pipelines have achieved sufficient functionality to 
support the start of survey operations, whether the data processing operation 
can process the data in a timely manner, and whether the distribution operation 
can effectively distribute the data to the SDSS collaboration. Finally, I want 
the committee to examine the plan to distribute the data to the astronomy 
community at large in accordance with the distribution plan developed in 
cooperation with the National Science Foundation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The specific charge 
for the review of the Data Processing and Distribution review is contained in 
five sets of questions, which we would like this Committee to answer:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Do the pipelines have sufficient functionality to support the start of the 
  five-year survey? Are the pipelines, as you find them on July 20 and 21, 
  sufficiently mature to achieve our scientific goals? Is the level of effort 
  assigned to each pipeline for that pipeline appropriate considering its 
  current maturity?<BR>
  <LI>Has the data processing staff developed the software tools to support a 
  five-year survey? Is the size of the data processing staff sufficient to 
  support the data, which will be obtained by a five-year survey?<BR>
  <LI>Is the hardware (computers, disk, and tape storage) for the data 
  processing and storage operations sufficient to support the analysis and 
  distribution of the data volume that will be generated by a five-year survey? 
  Are there adequate plans to deal with hardware and system software 
  obsolescence? Is medium for data storage adequate for the present (next ten 
  years)?<BR>
  <LI>The plan for distributing the data to the collaboration will be presented 
  at the review. Will the plan and its proposed implementation meet the needs of 
  the collaboration? The SDSS management welcomes suggestions for changes to the 
  plan or the method of implementation with in the framework of the existing 
  resources.<BR>
  <LI>The plan for distributing the data to the astronomy community at-large is 
  defined by a plan drawn up by the SDSS, subsequently reviewed and approved by 
  the NSF. Is the proposed implementation plan adequate and can it be done with 
  the existing resources.<BR>
  <LI>We hope to distribute a fraction of the data obtained prior to April 11, 
  to the astronomy community early in 2001. We do not plan to do this until the 
  data is fully calibrated. Will this processed data be sufficiently valuable to 
  the astronomy community to justify the effort that the SDSS project will have 
  to expend in distributing the data, considering the current status of the 
  project?</LI></UL>
