<H2 align=center>REQUIREMENTS FOR SDSS DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS</H2>
<H4 align=center>June 5, 1995<br>
Revision 1 - February 26, 2004</H4>
<I>[All requirements are subject to budgetary, 
manpower, and technical limitations] </I>
<P>The data management systems shall maintain all processed data from the SDSS 
and provide access by SDSS scientists and operators in order to maximize the 
ease of the following: 
<OL>
  <LI>Operate the SDSS survey so as to maximize the efficiency of operations. 
  <LI>Perform Quality Analysis operations on the data so as to ensure its 
  integrity. The operations will verify calibrations, target selection criteria 
  and classifications, and completeness &amp; accuracy. 
  <LI>Provide SDSS scientists with access to the data and tools to permit 
  selection of spectroscopic targets for certain categories (serendipity; 
  stars). 
  <LI>Provide SDSS scientists with access to the data so as to enable scientific 
  analyses. </LI></OL>
<HR>

<H2>Requirements for the Science Archive</H2>The science archive shall consist 
of: 
<OL>
  <LI>A science database that shall: 
  <DL compact>
    <DT><TT>a. </TT>Retain resolved calibrated object catalogs (photometric 
    CCD output) for two sky versions of the data: Best and Target. 
    <DT><TT>b. </TT>Retain parameters from spectroscopic pipeline 
    <DT><TT>c. </TT>Retain references to atlas images and extracted spectra 
    <DT><TT>d. </TT>Provide ability to carry out manual target selection for 
    certain target categories 
    <DT><TT>e. </TT>Provide ability for SDSS scientists to extract subsets of 
    retained data. 
    <DT><TT>f. </TT>Provide smooth transition to public distribution system. </DT></DL>
  <LI>A set of files tracked by the science database. 
  <LI>A set of files not tracked by the science database. </LI></OL>
A public version of the science database shall be a snapshot of the Science 
Archive.  The public version will include two versions of the sky: Best and
Target.  It will not include all runs obtained in the course of survey operations.<br><br>
An enhanced goal is to create a "Runs" database in addition to Target and Best
versions.  A Runs database would contain every imaging scan obtained over the
course of operations.
