<p>This charge is for the Committee to conduct an SDSS Director’s Review of the 
Catalog Archive Server (CAS) effort at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and 
Fermilab. The CAS provides the SDSS collaboration and the general astronomy 
community with an interface to the SDSS data products. The CAS is being 
developed at JHU; the current plan is to load and deploy the production CAS from 
Fermilab. This review will focus on the remaining development work for the CAS, 
the computer hardware required to deploy the CAS, and the plans for implementing 
the CAS at Fermilab.</p>
<p>The goal of the review is to assure SDSS management, as well as JHU and 
Fermilab management, that the plans and resources for completing the CAS and 
implementing it at Fermilab are reasonable and in place, or at a minimum that a 
reasonable plan and schedule exists for obtaining resources not yet in place 
(e.g., computer hardware systems).</p>
<p>Therefore, review presentations will include discussions of the SDSS data 
distribution plan; CAS development efforts, current status and remaining work; 
computer hardware requirements and plans for deploying and supporting the 
production CAS; plans for integrating the CAS into the production environment at 
Fermilab; and the current status of integration and lessons learned to date. The 
Committee is requested to comment on the information and plans presented during 
the review, with particular focus on the following questions:</p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p>Are the requirements for the CAS well-defined? If not, what areas should 
    be clarified?</p>
    <p>Is there a clear path to completion of the CAS development?</p>
    <p>Is the hardware implementation plan reasonable? In particular, is the 
    design of hot spares, the types of RAID arrays, etc. appropriate for meeting 
    the requirements? Is the plan for scaling the CAS to meet the needs at the 
    end of the survey sensible? Are the hardware costs well understood?</p>
    <p>Are the resources, including manpower at JHU and Fermilab, to deploy and 
    operate the CAS reasonable? Is the level of interaction between JHU and 
    Fermilab sufficient?</p>
  </dir>
</dir>
<p>The Committee should also assess how well the SDSS team has addressed 
recommendations made in the July 20-21, 2000 Director’s Review of SDSS Data 
Processing and Distribution that are relevant to the scope of this review. </p>
<p>Finally, the Committee should present findings, recommendations, comments and 
conclusions at a closeout meeting with SDSS management and the review 
participants, and provide a written report to the SDSS Director soon after the 
review.</p>
