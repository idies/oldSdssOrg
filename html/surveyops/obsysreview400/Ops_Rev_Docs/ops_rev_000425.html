and overall impressions</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">This document is the report of
impressions and recommendations written by the Review Team for the Operations
Readiness Review of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) conducted from April 25
to 27, 2000 at Apache Point Observatory (APO).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The overall impression is very
positive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All project personnel
have every reason to be very proud of their accomplishments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The project has confirmed the basic concept of the Survey and, even
though the actual Survey has not officially started, already has some impressive
science achievements to its credit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Review Team was extremely
impressed with the progress the SDSS Project has made to date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The imaging camera and spectrographs appear to be performing at or near
survey levels and are producing impressive scientific results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The facilities for instrument handling and configuration seem
professionally engineered and well suited to safely perform the required task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ability to acquire and process the staggering amount of astronomical
data is striking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The high level of
professionalism and dedication of the project personnel is widely evident.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Project already has some
impressive achievements to its credit, including not only the highest redshift
quasar found to date but a large enough sample of quasars to make an estimate of
the quasar luminosity function at redshifts higher than 3.5; the discovery of
several brown dwarfs; and the identification of enough halo stars to identify
tidal remnants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These early results
are widely known within the astronomical community and already demonstrate the
types of discoveries that will be enabled by such large, uniformly selected
samples of objects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The dataset
that will be provided by the complete Sloan survey will have a profound and
lasting impact on many fields of astrophysics.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The overall impression from the
review is that the engineering effort is well under control with a fairly well
defined set of issues to be completed in order to begin full-scale survey
operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no glaring
mechanical issues that had not been addressed already, in some fashion, by the
engineering team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With the
exception of some issues to do with image quality, the telescope performance
appears to be quite good and instrument performance meets specification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The telescope interlock system is well thought out with only a few
remaining issues to do with instrument interlocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Several efficiency related hardware enhancements were presented and the
scope and implementation of these improvements seems reasonable.</p>

Overview</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Overview-level documentation
for all aspects of the project was provided to the Review Team via www posting
previous to the review.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>More
in-depth information was provided in presentations at the review for all aspects
of the project except the data processing that is performed at Fermilab and the
Project Management structure and process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
separate review of the data processing performed at Fermilab will be conducted
at Fermilab before the end of July.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Paper
copies of the www posted information and the presentations were provided to the
Review Team at the review.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The initial review planning,
schedule, and logistics for housing, meals, and meetings were performed by the
SDSS project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The actual review
details and preparation of this report were performed by the Review Team.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">In addition to attendance and
discussion at the presentations, the Review Team organized themselves into three
breakout sessions, roamed the observatory watching operations and interacting
with Observers, met several times in executive session, and presented a
close-out session at the conclusion of the review.</p>

<h2 style="margin-right:27.0pt">2.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>A
note about duplication and negativity</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Review Team has taken the
position that this report should serve as a management tool to aid the Project
in the very difficult transition from construction/commissioning to production
operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Production&quot;
is emphasized here because this project has set very stringent quality,
quantity, and uniformity goals to achieve in a relatively short period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The &quot;production&quot; pressure in this project will be a constant
source of conflict adding to the already arduous task of managing such an
ambitious effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To that end, we
have assumed the fundamental question asked of us is not, What is right?
although a list of what is right would be very long, but, What is wrong? and
recommendations on approaches to address these issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>To the credit of the project, there follow more than 20 pages of What is
wrong?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We say &quot;to the credit
of the project&quot; because essentially all of the items listed were raised by
project personnel, most with proposed solutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The lists of items appear
longer than they really are because there is duplication of items from different
Team Members but from different perspectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The duplications remain to preserve the different perspectives in the
hope they will be useful to produce a more effective solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The size of the observing staff is a good example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear the observing staff is not large enough to accomplish all the
work required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One perspective is
the number of people required, another is how to most effectively use the
valuable resource represented by the high-level of personnel now on staff, and
another is the skill mix that may be suitable after some years of operations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The questions and answers are
included as recorded to preserve the original context.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This has resulted in more duplication but is retained to preserve the
additional insight provided by the different perspectives of the sources.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">While there are many issues to
address, as would be expected in such an ambitious endeavor, one must keep in
mind we are addressing the last few % of data quality and processes related to
observing efficiency, not any fundamental flaw in either concept or execution.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Again, the Review Team is very
positively impressed with the accomplishments to date and predicts a high
probability of success.</p>

this report</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">This report is largely a
compilation of writings by the Review Team members, questions asked by the
Review Team members, and answers to these questions written by Project staff
within a few hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Section and
subsection numbering and headings have been added to facilitate organization and
referencing, however, the original text is retained to preserve the tone and
context of the original writings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this
report correspond to the breakout session numbers 1, 2, and 3 above and
contain the Review Team member's writings organized by breakout session.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 8 is a list of the Review Team members.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The original hard copy report
contained a section of the questions and answers organized by breakout session
and&nbsp; a section about an Email
discussion conducted by two reviewers a few days after the review about the
performance versus efficiency controversy.&nbsp; It also contained a section
with comments by one reviewer, who was also a reviewer for the
secondary mirror damage investigation, about the justification for replacing the
mount with the new design and a section of&nbsp; one reviewer's list of work items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

to the Review Team</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The construction phase of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey is complete, the testing phase is nearly complete, and
commissioning operations have been underway for some time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Science quality data has been obtained from the commissioning operations,
analyzed, and published.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Survey
is now making the transition from commissioning to routine operations. This
transition is not complete and there is much to be done as we shift our focus
from building and testing equipment to making the equipment reliable and
efficient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the same time,
we are building a scientific staff, which will bring to fruition the goals that
we established a decade ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
goals were to image about 10,000 square degrees of the Northern Galactic Cap; to
select from those images a million objects, primarily galaxies and quasars; to
obtain spectra of those objects; and to create a catalog of those images and
spectra, first for the astronomers from the participating institutions and then
for the astronomy community-at-large.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We are planning two reviews of
the Survey in order to help us set our course for the next five years. The first
review, which will be held at Apache Point, from April 25 to 27, will examine
whether the Observing Systems and the Observatory Support will be able to
sustain the five years of observing and produce the quality of data that is
needed to achieve our scientific objectives. The second review will be held at
Fermilab, the site of the SDSS data processing and distribution, prior to the
end of July. In that review we will ask the reviewers to examine whether the
data processing operations can process the data in a timely manner and
effectively distribute it to the collaboration and then the astronomy community
at large in accordance with our distribution plan developed in cooperation with
the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The specific charge for the
review of the Observing Systems and Observatory support is contained in three
sets of questions, which we would like this Review Team to answer:</p>
<p class="Bullet" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:27.0pt;margin-bottom:6.0pt;
margin-left:31.0pt">•<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Will the Observing Systems, with the proposed improvements, be
ready to support the five-year survey?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Will
they, as you find them on April 25, be sufficient to achieve our scientific
goals?&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:27.0pt;margin-bottom:4.0pt;

</span>As of April 25, the data do meet, apart from possible questions of image
quality, the quality requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
project is far short of being able to produce data in the required quantities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Solving that problem will require a substantial investment in real-time
software, and it is not clear whether adequate resources have been identified.<o:p>
</o:p>

survey? In particular has the SDSS Management given them the tools and training
to carry out the survey? Is the size of the observing staff sufficient to
support a five-year survey?&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="1" style="margin-top:0in;margin-right:27.0pt;margin-bottom:4.0pt;
margin-left:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A: <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;
</span>The observing staff appears to have the commitment, competence, and
training required, apart possibly from issues of quality assessment of the data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is not clear they have the tools required to achieve adequate
efficiency of operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
observing staff needs to be augmented by one, but in addition, closer attention
needs to be paid to optimizing the range of skill levels, the way shifts are
scheduled, and the effective use of the observers.<o:p>

versus quantity conflict management</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">In any production activity, the
desire to improve the product will be in conflict with the desire to produce a
larger quantity of data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be
extremely important to define &quot;good enough&quot; and to resist requirements
creep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The expansion of the science
utility of the survey beyond its current state is evident and future expansion,
while noble in ideal, may place at the risk the ability to achieve the necessary
volume within the available resources.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.1.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mechanism
for tracking production progress, conic progress charts</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Transitioning into the
production mode of the survey will be challenging.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>As we reviewed the presentations, the challenges being
experienced in the transition from commissioning to operation were evident.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">More detailed and thoughtful
analysis will be necessary to identify the areas of efficiency or performance
improvements required to achieve the necessary production rates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must focus attention on the trades that will be required between
performance improvements and efficiency improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These items are at different ends of the project time horizon and need to
be viewed in harmony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Review Team concluded that
a top-level metric would be helpful in both focusing the goals of the survey as
well as tracking the progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
a tool would assist in identifying where actions are required to ensure the end
result meets the scientific requirements within the allocated budget.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The example charts shown in Figures 1 and 2 could be used to track the
progress of the survey over the funded five years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The survey objectives are expressed as minimum accomplishments for survey
success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower level bounds the
science projects enabled with the currently achieved system performance over
square degrees of sky in Figure 1 and number of redshifts in Figure 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The upper level is what additional science projects would be
enabled with slightly improved performance and a more optimistic assessment of
sky coverage or number of spectra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By
plotting the progress in these areas, everyone associated with the project can
tell at a glance the progress to date.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">At this juncture, the team
suggests that more attention should be applied to improving the operational
efficiency of the survey even if it is at the risk of delaying or eliminating
additional performance improvements.</p>

Management</h2>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.2.1<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Project
Management Overview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Some data of the caliber
required for the survey have already been obtained, even at this early stage of
operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we also heard
about many improvements that could be made in both hardware and software that
would improve performance, reliability, efficiency, and safety.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What was not presented to us was a systems level overview of relative
importance of these various improvement projects when measured against the
scientific requirements of the survey, a method for establishing the priorities
among the different projects, an integrated schedule for completing them, or a
mapping of projects onto available budget and manpower resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The tools for managing projects were not in evidence during our visit,
and so we are not able to determine the extent to which they are being used.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in a project of this complexity, given the
distributed nature of the staff and resources, and the competing and probably
conflicting claims for regular observations and continued enhancements to the
facility, the use of project management tools is essential.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.2.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Real-time
software</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Management of software
development is notoriously more difficult than the management of hardware
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not surprisingly, it is
our impression that the real-time software for supporting operations is
converging more slowly than the non-real-time software and hardware components
of the system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since a very high
level of efficiency as measured in terms of time on the sky is required in order
to achieve the project goals in a period of five years, resources will have to
be identified for continued software development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Quantitative goals for efficiency should be established, and priorities
for new software should be determined in order to achieve those goals as early
in the project as resources permit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Improved
automation in instrument set up, more efficient instrument changes, and
real-time quality assessment of data would all enhance throughput.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.2.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personnel
safety</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Safety must be a major concern
for any astronomical observatory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Small
groups of people are working in remote locations around massive moving
machinery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Equipment worth up to a
million dollars or even more must be operated, handled, and repaired, often late
at night when people are tired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Severe
environmental conditions, including lightning storms or blizzards that prevent
access for days at a time, are common.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
staff of the SDSS is very aware of these issues and has taken some steps to
address them. We particularly commend the staff for scheduling an external
review of safety by experts from other organizations. However, we recommend that
priority be given to establishing clear and enforced procedures for tagging and
lockout of systems that may present dangers to personnel; to providing systems
for lightning protection and specifying procedures for disconnecting key
equipment and taking other appropriate steps during storms; and to creating an
environment that encourages safety consciousness on the part of staff and
visitors and facilitates the reporting of safety problems.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.2.4<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unauthorized
network access</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We are concerned about external
access to the SDSS computer network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Hacking
is an increasingly serious problem for all networked systems, and observatories
are frequently targets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Appropriate
security measures should be put in place that allow reasonably convenient access
by external staff but that provide a substantial challenge to unauthorized
users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an area that will
have to be continuously reviewed and updated.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.2.5<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equipment
safety, Instrument-change risk</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The current plan of operations
calls for changing between imaging and spectroscopy during the night as image
quality and cloud cover change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
overhead of this change is substantial and each instrument change involves some
degree of risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Steps should be
taken to:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1) speed up the process
of changing of instruments; 2) make the process as risk free as possible
including possibly limiting the number of instrument changes per night to one
and/or restricting how late at night they can occur; and 3) accumulating data
that enable simulations to determine whether such instrument changes actually
enhance throughput. For example, if seeing is typically strongly variable over
hourly intervals during the night, it may be better to wait out an hour of bad
seeing rather than switch to spectroscopy on photometric nights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some primitive forecasting tools may be helpful; if the jet stream is
over the site or a front is moving through, for example, good seeing is very
unlikely, and the night should probably be dedicated to spectroscopy.</p>

<h2 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Management
of Science Requirements for the SDSS</h2>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3.1<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Requirements
Overview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">A detailed evaluation of the
science requirements for the SDSS is available in <u>Scientific Requirements and
Scientific Commissioning for the SDSS</u>, written and/or edited by M. Strauss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This document outlines the scope of the project, its scientific goals,
and provides quality specifications for the data to be cataloged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Review Team is truly impressed at the degree to which most of these
goals have been met or exceeded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
example, the 100mas astrometric accuracy greatly exceeds the 180mas
&quot;Drop-Dead&quot; requirement and already meets the goal required for proper
motion determinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughput
goals for the imager are reached for all but one CCD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The spectrographs essentially meet or exceed all criteria tested thus
far, including throughput, resolution, wavelength coverage, and stability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">These and other technical feats
attest to exceptional talent, effort, and dedication on the part of all
involved.</b></p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Observing
efficiency overview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The one survey criterion that
is still far from adequate is overall efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the project is to achieve its stated imaging and spectroscopic goals,
it must achieve a collective change in perspective from one of
&quot;building&quot; to one of &quot;producing&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This change in perspective also necessitates a change
in attitude and management philosophy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
evaluating a proposed modification in hardware or procedure, consideration must
be given not only to cost (in dollars) and benefit (in data quality), but also
to the project downtime required to implement the modification.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once the 5-year clock begins to run, every hour that the telescope is not
on the sky is another portion of a stripe that is not imaged, or a field that
will not produce spectra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
reality poses a real dilemma for most astronomers, who are not accustomed to
thinking in terms of production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
research scientists, it is our nature to push an idea or technology to its
physical limits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yielding to that
tendency at this point in the SDSS must be very critically weighed against the
impact of the decision on the eventual science that is obtainable from the data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A case in point is the current desire to improve the secondary mirror
support to potentially improve an astrometric accuracy that already meets or
exceeds all projected goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
the quandary is evident across the project: from image quality to CCD
performance to calibration requirements.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Method
for evaluating observing efficiency versus performance</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">In delving into this question,
it is the opinion of the Review Team that the SDSS scientific/ management staff
has not yet implemented a firm mechanism for evaluating the scientific impact of
technical and operational decisions that must be made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For example, the Strauss document fails to quantify the scientific
compromise that would result from failing to reach ANY of the technical
specifications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is our
recommendation that a small group of scientists from the member institutions
with deep interests in the project should be assembled to carefully consider the
scientific goals of the project and justify the technical requirements and real
coverage which are motivated by that science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This input would be an essential ingredient to the setting of the
performance benchmarks by which progress will be judged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The group should also evaluate the scientific impact of proposed upgrades
in hardware or changes in operational policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>At a minimum, this process would weigh possible improvements in data
quality against the likely reductions in sky coverage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In some cases, tradeoffs of performance vs. instrument safety might also
need to be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Final
decisions on such proposals would, of course, be made by the Project Director on
the basis of the recommendation of that group as well as the advice of the
Project Scientist and Project Manager.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
starting point for this scientific advisory committee might be the existing SOC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Another reviewer comments:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Observing efficiency versus
performance section 5.3.3 highlighted the need for a committee of survey
scientists that can trade performance and coverage against scientific goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That point is relevant to a question that Jim Gunn asked us about
near-term tactics.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Jim wanted to know if they should shut down for a couple of
months and fix everything or continue to have a mix of science verification data
gathering and improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our
point should be to emphasize that the project needs a process whereby they can
answer such questions for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
process requires adequate management information and the benchmarks to assess
impact on science.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If such
questions are handed to the science committee for evaluation, their advice then
informs the director's decision, mediated by the Project Scientist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The existence of such an apparatus would engage the scientific partners
and allow the kind of trades we've been advocating.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3.4<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Observing
efficiency versus observing staff</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The required increase in survey
efficiency also drives a need for better organization of effort within the
mountain staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the Review
Team was not presented with an overall organization chart of personnel, it was
not possible to accurately evaluate lines of communication or the adequacy of
the staff to address the outstanding technical and operational problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, this must improve.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Timetables
must be generated for the completion of key outstanding software and hardware
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Manpower must be identified and their time budgeted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Safety procedures must be solidified, followed, and monitored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The existing talent mix must be evaluated in the context of a production
operation, and adjustments made where necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In short, a &quot;top-down&quot; approach must be adopted, where the
primary benchmark is progress toward completion of the survey.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">5.3.5<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Observers
as resource, Lead Observer</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">An important resource which
appears to be largely overlooked is the team of Observers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps more than any other group at this point, these individuals will
be essential in realizing the project’s potential.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Ph.D.-level scientists, they are an expensive team with a great deal
of talent to offer toward reaching the overall efficiency goals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is clear to this Review Team that the Observers also take a
personal stake in the success of the project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The current organization, however, does not provide an effective means
for them to exercise their talents and education or a good path for their ideas
to be communicated to the higher-level scientific and managerial staff where
they might be implemented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
result is reduced survey productivity and a disillusioned observing staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is the very strong opinion of the Review Team that a Head Observer
should be hired, among whose duties would be the management and organization of
the Observers, the setting of their schedules, their hiring and training, and
the setting of their duties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He/she
would also monitor the overall performance of the team, fill in for
sickness/vacation, and coordinate observing procedures with relevant management
personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Head Observer would
act not only as a conduit for raising important suggestions and concerns of the
Observers, but also as a filter for the many competing influences that they
otherwise receive.</p>

of responsibility to Observers</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">During the commissioning phase,
these issues were best addressed by engineering and project people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, moving now into an operations mode, it is felt that the people
charged with delivering the &quot;product&quot;, i.e. the Observers, should now
play a more prominent role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
particularly true if one considers a chart showing % complete survey versus
time, which is reflected in the strategy that SDSS needs to adopt over the
coming years.<span style="mso-spacerun:

this, to play a leading role.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.1.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Impediments
to observing efficiency</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The Observers group was asked

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">It is felt that with the
current problems and inefficiencies, there was no way the spectroscopic portion
of the survey could be completed in any reasonable time scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The particular problems mentioned were: guide fiber acquisition speed,
poor pointing model, stable focus, and extra (possibly unnecessary)
calibrations.</p>
<h4 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.1.2.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>On-Line
Quality Assessment Tools</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The lack of these prevents a
real-time assessment of the data quality and completeness. This means the
exposure times are probably being extended unnecessarily longer to guarantee
good quality data.</p>
<h4 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.1.2.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Documentation
and troubleshooting experience</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">A lack of proper documentation
and troubleshooting experience has meant that problems often take longer to fix
than they should.</p>
<h4 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.1.2.4<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Building-motion
conservatism</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The complicated operation of
the building roll-off and roll-on requires they be more conservative with
observing conditions since the SDSS telescope is more exposed and vulnerable in
case of a sudden weather change.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.1.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Informed
rather than involved</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Since the Observers are now
playing a leading role in the completion of the SDSS survey, their involvement
in the process of problem solving and follow-up needs to change. The
issues/problems they have raised which effect the efficiency of their
observations are of critical importance with the SDSS moving into an Operations
mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A greater involvement in the
Prioritization, follow-up, and deadlines for improvements and problem fixes
should be given to the Observers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">This process requires closer
consultation and collaboration with Engineering.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>One comment we heard repeated several times was that the
Observers are not internal to this process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are &quot;informed&quot; rather than &quot;involved&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One way of improving this situation might be to provide greater overlap
with daytime engineering operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
for the evening hand-over and start up, but also in the morning when engineering
work is being planned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some type of
regular formal meetings between Observers and Engineering to plan and prioritize
should be organized.</p>

Overview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">In the data production phase of
the survey, the observers represent a key asset for efficient and successful
completion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were selected to
have research experience and interest in the survey data.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That level of expertise is highly valuable during the current
commissioning stage, during which they can identify, verify, and occasionally
implement improvements to operational efficiency, particularly at the software
and user interface level.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Several
personnel issues related to this group should be addressed in order to assure
their productivity and longevity with the project.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.2.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Observing
Staffing Schedule cannot be maintained</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">In the documents provided for
the review and in the presentations and discussions, it was clear that the
current staffing schedule is not maintainable over the long run.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In order to avoid burnout, two objectives must be realized in the near
term, without compromising safety and with minimal impact on operational
efficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>One is to significantly
reduce or eliminate the frequency of &quot;shift slipping&quot;, in which
schedules are changed among full night, early evening, late evening, and days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The observers are currently showing the signs of fatigue that come to any
shift workers that have to alternate shifts frequently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other is to allow more substantial overlap with day workers, with
benefits to on-site operations as discussed above.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>More extensive overlap with consortium scientists during
working hours is another significant advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Several creative alternatives to the current paired shift assignments are
possible, and should be explored.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.2.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lead
Observer, off-shift time recommended</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The observers themselves
suggested two additional observers should be added to the staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We recommend that the current complement be augmented by one, in order to
create the position of Lead Observer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
primary purpose is effective management of this key scientific resource.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A major goal of the position is to give the observers a more significant
voice in the scientific planning and execution of the survey.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This individual will interact with (and preferably be part
of) the project management team, assuring that the priorities as articulated by
the observers for investments to enhance survey efficiency are considered
carefully in the course of project prioritization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This lead person will communicate the priorities and status of the
project to the observers, coordinate their scheduling, plan their non-shift
observatory projects, guide their skill enhancement and career development, and
personally serve on shift, to be both an effective group leader and to create
more off-shift time for the observers.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.2.4<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Migration
of responsibility to Observers</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">With a strong site-based cadre
of observers, responsibility for tactical decision-making on execution of the
survey should devolve to the site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following
the models of queue observing at ESO and WIYN, the imaging and spectroscopic
goals for each full lunation would be developed by the science planning team,
then transmitted to APO, where the observers would make the nightly choices
about the details of program execution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
observers still desire frequent communication with the off-site survey team
members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This level of delegation
of responsibility is appropriate for the skill level of the observers and the
nature of the &quot;production&quot; phase of the Survey.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.2.5<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Future
Observer Skill-mix</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">As the survey progresses and
data acquisition becomes a more nearly routine activity, it will be worthwhile
to consider a change of skill mix if the necessity arises to fill a vacant
observer position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ph.D.-level
research experience is a worthwhile prerequisite for data quality assurance and
assessment of short- and long-term impact on science of instrument and telescope
anomalies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a background will
be less critical for telescope, instrument, and facility operations when these
functions are mature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
Survey management should consider replacement with a more traditional
&quot;telescope operator&quot; profile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For
the remaining, relatively short duration of the survey, that person could be
assigned nearly exclusively to operating shifts, further freeing the observers
to concentrate more on data quality, pipeline applications, and the option of
longer blocks of non-work hours to make progress on science projects.</p>

Operations Overview</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">The operational software
appears to be in good shape overall to support initial observing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is clearly additional functionality needed and many rough edges to
be addressed to provide software to support efficient operations that are
maintainable through five years of production data taking.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Improved
Observer Interfaces, dedicated status displays</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Many different software
sub-systems have been integrated to support operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with the assessment that a layer of software integration,
including user friendly interfaces, and easy to organize and use status
displays, is needed to support 5 years of operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We encourage the survey to find the resources to implement a first
version of this over the next few months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
these are the panels that are in daily use by the Observing staff, the
requirements should be identified through watching their use of the software
during observations and discussion of their needs and ideas towards more
efficient operation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We recommend the addition or
allocation of dedicated status screens in the control room to show existing and
enhanced status displays.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.3<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Increased
functionality of Observer's Programs <span style="font-weight:normal">(IOP, SOP,
MOP), </span>companion observer</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">There is a need for increased
functionality and stability of the xOP programs and for real-time quality
analysis of the data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For increased
operational efficiency, both in the short and long term, the Observers must have
continued interaction and the opportunity to work with the developers
responsible for this software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
quality analysis programs should be configured to ensure they do not perturb the
main observing process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
speed of the networks allow, perhaps there is an opportunity for a
&quot;companion observer&quot; at Fermilab to help with QA during observing.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.4<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plan
to transition the focus from development to production operations</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We were not presented with a
prioritized list of software tasks, assignments, and schedule.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We recommend that one be posted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
were not presented with any plan for the transition from development of the
software to an operations focus and any accompanying transfer of knowledge and
responsibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We recommend that
such a plan be developed to address operational use of the software for the next
five years.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.5<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Configuration
management and documentation</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We endorse a long-term
commitment to configuration management and to provide operational and reference
documentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We encourage
including documentation in configuration management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We recommend including regular inspections (code and documentation) in
the configuration management plan.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.6<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Support
for MCP and real-time programming</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We agree with the concern and
recommendation to identify someone with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>long-term
responsibility for the maintenance and support of the Motion Control Processor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We recommend the &quot;intermittent axis-motion problems&quot; be fixed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Attention should continue to be paid to this software and if problems
persist effort identified to do the necessary rewrite of the PVT code.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Concern that the MCP code is not interpolating all TCC commands correctly
should be understood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We identified
a lack of real-time programming expertise at APO and recommend that some be
acquired to provide backup support for the experts at Fermilab.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.7<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One-person
software risk</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">We encourage the software
project management to maintain awareness of those parts of the software that
have only one person with any knowledge of the internals or one person who has
contributed to the code.</p>
<h3 style="margin-right:27.0pt">6.3.8<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plan
and schedule for upgrades and maintenance</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">A schedule for deployment of
the semi-automated instrument-change system should be posted and the necessary

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:27.0pt">Plans for incremental upgrade
of the data acquisition system to address those parts becoming unsupportable
seem appropriate. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Sufficient time
should be planned for the integration and testing of changes.</p>
