<p>The controls and interlocks review will be held at Fermilab.&nbsp; Directions for
getting to Fermilab can be found at the <a
href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/visitor_info.html" target="_top">Fermilab Visitors
Information</a> web site.&nbsp;&nbsp; The review will take place in Curia II, which is a
meeting room on the second floor of Wilson Hall.&nbsp; Wilson Hall is the 16-story hi-rise
building at Fermilab.&nbsp; Since it's the only hi-rise on the site, you won't be able to
miss it. &nbsp; To reach Curia II, enter Wilson Hall through the main doors and walk
through the atrium to the stairs at the south end of the cafeteria.&nbsp; Go up the stairs
to the second floor and turn right (east).&nbsp; Curia II is located in the southeast
corner of the building.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For our out-of-town guests, there are many hotels near Fermilab.&nbsp; A list of these
can be found at the Fermilab <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/acommodation.html"
target="_top">accommodations</a> website.&nbsp; Many offer special rates for Fermilab
visitors, so please be sure to ask for these when making reservations.&nbsp; As a point of
reference, all of the reviewers will be staying at the Holiday Inn in Naperville.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We will start the reviews promptly at 8:30 am each day and will finish by 4:00 pm on
Thursday, July 15.&nbsp; In making your travel arrangements out of Chicago, allow at least
two hours for the drive from Fermilab to the airport (either O'Hare or Midway). &nbsp;
Chicago rush-hour traffic can be brutal.</p>
