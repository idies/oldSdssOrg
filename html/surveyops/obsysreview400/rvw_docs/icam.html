The SDSS imaging camera was delivered to APO in October 1997 and
completely reassembled in the clean room in December of that year.  It
saw its first light on the 2.5m in May 1998.  We have since fixed the
cause of a few electronics problems that showed up in the original
data, and have tried to make the instrument as it is installed at the
telescope easy to care for and robust.  A technical description of the
design of instrument is far outside the scope of this review, and can
be found in Gunn et al.  (AJ 116, 3040. 1998).<br>

The CCDs are mounted off the back side of the second imaging corrector
lens, and that lens is carried mechanically by a stainless steel ring
that attaches to the telescope on kinematic mounts.  The CCD
electronics and liquid nitrogen cooling system and the rest of the
support electronics are back behind the CCDs within the circumference
of the steel ring.  The whole instrument is roughly cylindrical with a
diameter of about a meter and a depth 2/3 that at the high point of
the back cover, and weighs approximately 700lbs.  Surrounding the
camera is an open rectangular structure we call the saddle which is
mounted to the telescope independently from the camera and carries the
weight of the 400lbs of powersupplies and liquid nitrogen supply
resevoirs that are connected to the camera through cables and
vacuum-jacketed hoses.  The imager is mounted to the telescope on the
central rotator bearing when it is taking data and is stored on its
cart in a small enclosure on the telescope's rotating floor when it is
not.  <a href = "/surveyops/obsysreview400/25rotat.jpg"> Figure 1 </a> shows the imager mounted on the back of the telescope,
between the two green spectrograph bodies.  The back cover is off,
exposing some of its maze of plumbing and cables.  <br>
<br>
The 54 CCDs in the imager are housed in eight independent dewars, each
with its own LN2 resevoir, autofill plumbing, powersupply and data
output to the DA system.  The dewars are evacuated to a few 10^-7 Torr
when cold and contain the CCDs mounted on their optical benches,
preamplifier and signal-conditioning circuitry for the CCD clocking
signals and a 200ml LN2 resevoir and the associated thermal regulation
system for the detectors.  The double-correlated sampling and 16-bit
digitization circuitry for each CCD is mounted in an enclosure on the
back of its dewar, and the parallelized data for all the CCDs in a
dewar is brought out on fiber.  All the CCDs are clocked
synchronously, and the clock waveforms are derived from a master 8MHz
clock.  The digital signals are carried around the instrument on RS485
busses, and converted to and if necessary retransmitted from 5V CMOS
where they are used.  <a href = "/surveyops/obsysreview400/camassy.ps">Figure 2 </a> is a schematic diagram of the focal
plane layout.  <a href = "/surveyops/obsysreview400/dewar_sketch.ps">Figure 3 </a> is a drawing of a single dewar, showing the
detectors on their optical benches, the associated signal-processing
electronics in their chassis on the back, and the LN2 resevoir in the
center.<br>
<br>

Each dewar runs from a set of power supplies kept in the chassis on
the saddle, and the voltages they generate are monitored in hardware
for under- or overvoltage conditions.  If a supply is 10% beyond its
nominal value the entire set of supplies for that dewar is shut down
and must be swapped out or otherwise tended to.  Operating procedure
is to swap out the module if the problem is in the supply, with more
detailed debugging done off-line during the day<br>
<br>

Everything in the instrument is controlled by Forth code running on a
Hitachi H8/532-based microcontroller made by Triangle Digital Systems,
Ltd.  Communication to the outside world is over a 9600-baud RS232
serial connection.  The microcontroller manages the configuration of a
slave exactly like itself that is busy full-time generating the
clocking signals for the CCDs.  Through its I/O ports the micro also
controls the shutter and the LN2 autofill, sets the DACs that control
the 21 operating voltages for each CCD, and monitors the state of the
instrument.  The health and safety monitoring is quite extensive and
is an integral part of the instrument's robustness and safety; it will
be discussed below.  The Forth code is put in an EPROM on the
microcontroller, and the code is kept under version control.  The
micro can return the value of a version string stored in the EPROM,
and the same string is the tag used to retrieve the corresponding
Forth source from the Survey's CVS repository.<br>
<br>

The CCDs are thermally connected to the LN2 resevoirs through
conductive straps that bring them to thermal equilibrium somewhat
below their desired operating temperature.  A proportional control loop
uses a temperature sensor and heater resistor to keep each CCD at its
operating temperature.  The LN2 resevoirs will hold for about two
hours, and are filled once an hour from the 10L intermediate storage
dewars on the saddle on command from the microprocessor.  The autofill
system runs on pressure gradients, and the LN2 system is kept at about
10psi.  To fill the resevoirs in the dewars, solenoid valves open on
the vent side of each resevoir's plumbing and LN2 flows down the
pressure gradient and into the resevoirs.  If the microprocessor for
some reason does not properly control the fill system, the low-level
control electronics automatically triggers a fill if a resevoir goes
empty.  The 10L dewars are filled on the same principle from a
standard 180L 22psi supply dewar on the rotating floor.  The control
is less sophisticated and is not done through the microprocessor.  A
180L dewar lasts 24 to 36 hours.<br>
<br>

The optical benches that mount all the CCDs in each dewar are located
in the focal plane on kinematic mounts.  The mounts work by allowing
titanium balls to roll along stainless steel rods in each corner of
the rectangular optical benches.  By changing the relative rotation of
the stainless steel rails between the corners, the optical benches are
constrained in all dimensions.  The mounts are accurate and
repeatable, but because the contact area between the balls and rods is
small they are susceptible to damage from the forces transmitted to
them during normal handling of the instrument.  For this reason, the
optical benches are latched away from the kinematic mounts when the
camera is not observing.  The motion toward and away from the focal
plane is accomplished by inflating or contracting a set of bellows in
each dewar, and control is through a valve that switches the hoses for
the bellows between high-purity 40psi N2 to inflate them and a source
of vacuum to contract them.  Moving the mechanical benches on and off
the kinematics is part of the process of instrument change for the
imager.  <a href = "/surveyops/obsysreview400/bench.ps"> Figure 4</a> is a photograph of one dewar's CCD mounting
hardware.  The optical bench is face-up on the left.  The rods for the
kinematic mounts are visible in the four corners, and at the bottom
the picture is looking down on one of the latches that holds the bench
off the kinematics for handling.<br>
<br>

Because of design constraints this motion will only work if the
instrument is vertical, and it is possible to damage the kinematic
mounts if the optical benches are moved with gravity pulling them
toward the ends of the dewars.  It is thus very important that the
optical benches be properly on their kinematic mounts when the imager
is on the telescope and it is slewed away from zenith, and that they
are latched off their kinematic mounts when the imager is taken off
the telescope before it is rolled back into its enclosure.<br>
<br>

Because the imager does not know its own orientation, the
microprocessor does not have control over the motion of the optical
benches.  Instead, there is four-signal interface between the the PLC
and the hardware in the imager that controls the valves for the
bellows.  Two signals come from the PLC to the imager to command
motion and two signals are returned to the PLC from the imager to
report status.  The PLC can command the optical benches to be either
on the kinematic mounts (unlatched) for observing or latched away for
safe handling of the camera, and the PLC interlock logic will only
pass this request if the telescope altitude is above 88 degrees.  The
bellows valve controller can measure the pressure in each dewar's
bellows hose and compare it against the supply sources of 40psi N2 and
vacuum, and knows which one it expects to match given the commanded
position.  If the pressure for all the dewars matches the correct
supply, then the control hardware will claim to believe the optical
benches are latched or unlatched and assert the appropriate status
line to the PLC.  The microprocessor can see both status signals and
report them through its RS232 interface.  There is an additional check
on the instrument's orientation from a tiltmeter mounted inside the
camera.  It produces a binary output which changes state when it moves
through an angle 2 degrees from vertical.  This output is incorporated
into the bellows valve control logic, and a latch or unlatch command
will be refused if the tiltmeter indicates that the instrument is not
vertical.  The micro has access to this bit so it can be interrogated
if a latch command fails.  The micro can also report the values of the
bellows pressure for all eight dewars, and the value of the absolute
pressure in the vacuum supply.<br>
<br>

All this information, plus gauge readings of the supplies and a gauge
mounted on the side of the imager that reads the pressure in one
dewar's bellows hose directly, can be made available during instrument
change.  There is a toggle-switch control box that can be plugged into
the control cable in place of the PLC interface to move the optical
benches directly.  As a last resort there is a ball valve that can
switch the source of the 40psi N2 supply hose between 40psi and
vacuum.  This can be used to move the optical benches by taking
advantage of the fact that with the control cable disconnected the
bellows valves will always switch the hoses to the 40psi supply input
to the camera.  This behavior of the valves is a precaution to keep
the optical benches from moving if the instrument should lose power
while pointed at an arbitrary position on the sky.<br>
<br>

There is a single cable bundle that goes to the imager which remains
attached when the instrument is on the telescope and in its enclosure.
It carries AC UPS power, LN2 from the 180L supply dewar, water-glycol
for the heat exchangers, compressed air for the shutter actuators, N2
for the autofill pressurization, vacuum and high-grade N2 for the
optical bench bellows motion, the signals from the PLC to control the
optical bench motion, the optical fibers that carry the RS232
communication with the camera and the 10 optical fibers that bring the
digitized pixel data out to the data acquisition system.  Any signal
brought to the instrument on copper originates at the imager's
rotating rack and is carefully referenced to the instrument's master
ground.  The run from the rack up to the instrument is as short as is
practical for both noise and lightning safety considerations.<br>
<br>

<h3><FONT size=3>Health and Safety Monitoring </FONT>    </h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><FONT size=2>

The imager is kept ready to take data at all times so that it can
always take advantage of good observing conditions.  It is also an
essential part of the Survey and as such it should be as difficult as
possible for any harm to come to it.  It is also important that it not
require an inordinate amount of attention from the observers and APO
staff so that they do not spend too much of their time and energy on
hardware support, and so that the instrument will be safe over long
periods of inattention when blizzards, dust storms, overturned trucks
on the Sunspot Highway, etc., keep its normal caretakers from their
rounds.<br>
<br>

The microcontroller that runs the imager has access to the important
information about every subsystem.  All the voltage levels are brought
to a 10-bit A/D converter built into the Hitachi processor through an
analog multiplexor, and the CMOS binary status information is all
available on the micro's input ports.  The micro runs a continuous
background process that loops through the subsystems and looks at each
piece of status information.  It compares its measurement against a
nominal value and tolerance, if applicable, and if it is outside the
acceptable range a corresponding error flag is set.  There is a Forth
command that has the micro go through the list of error flags and
return a list of all the errors and some information on why the flags
were set.  This list of errors is available all the time, updated
roughly every four minutes as the micro cycles through its list of
things to be checked.  We have tried to make the list exhaustive so
that any failure mode that can adversely effect the data or harm the
instrument will be caught by the micro and made available to the
outside world through a single command.  The micro will not volunteer
any information as a safeguard against clogging RS232 communication,
and to cut down on chatter will return only the standard Forth "ok" if
it does not detect any errors.  There are other commands to return the
values of status measurements that the micro records as it goes
through the monitoring loop, and these are designed to provided
long-term performance monitoring of the instrument.  A complete list
of everything checked by the micro is appended to the end of this
document.<br>
<br>

For most error conditions that the micro can see, it is sufficient
that it report the error when it is asked.  The data may be junk or
the instrument out of service for a day or two if it goes undetected,
but there is no threat of permanent harm to the instrument.  There is
a subset of error conditions, however, that if unrectified could result
in damage to the imager.  Since it is impossible to require that there
always be someone on-site to handle such situations the imager
responds to these on its own, whether or not its error status is ever
queried.  It does so by doing the only thing that is guaranteed to be
safe, which is to shut itself off.  It does so by allowing a watchdog
timer to expire, which in turn opens a relay contact to cut off
incoming AC power and turns the instrument off.  Normally the imager
resets this timer every time it executes the monitoring process after
checking that none of the designated errors are present.  The
monitoring loop is done as part of the high-level functioning of the
microprocessor, so if it hangs or crashes and stays down the watchdog
timer will run out.  This is alleviated by a second watchdog with a
much shorter timeout that the micro must actively reset in the same
monitoring process; when this timer expires it executes a cold reset
of the micro which should reboot it and restart the monitoring process
before the instrument power shuts off.<br>
<br>

The following errors will result in the watchdog timer shutting down
power to the instrument:<br>
<br>

-- Any of the CCD amplifier VDD voltages too high<br>
<br>

-- No flow in the water-glycol input lines to the imager from the
chiller.  This is measured by closure of a switch contact in a flow
sensor mounted in the input line to the instrument.<br>
<br>

-- Saddle powersupply chassis temperature above 45 C.  This is quite
possible to reach if the chiller is not running.<br>
<br>

-- CCD temperatures above 40 degrees C.  They can (and will) get there
if the detectors start at room temperature and are clocked
continuously for an hour or so with the LN2 system not running.<br>
<br>

-- Instrument air or outer chassis temperature above 40 C.<br>

<h3><FONT size=3>Current status </FONT> </h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>

The last piece of functionality that has not yet been implemented is
the PLC and IOP interface for controlling the optical benches.  We
have so far left the control cable unplugged and positioned the
optical benches by using the valve in the rack to force them to move.
The imager's side of the control electronics for the bellows valves,
the micro's access to the status bits and tiltmeter and the optical
isolation and surge suppression for the signals in the PLC interface
were finished before the instrument was shipped.  They have been
tested and used to some limited extent while we worked in the clean
room at Princeton and at APO, and exercised with the beginnings of the
PLC interface in the last few months.  The imager is otherwise a
reasonably self-contained system, but the optical bench control
requires the coordination of many normally-independent parts of 2.5m
operations so there are sure to be software and perhaps hardware
modifications to the imager necessary to make the process work
smoothly and transparently.<br>
<br>

The only outstanding problem preventing the imager from taking good
data that that we would like to keep for the Survey is an intermittent
noise problem with the u' CCD in dewar 2.  Other problems that need to
be addressed as soon as possible are a recent problem in the leading
astrometric dewar that causes CCD heater power supplies to trip their
monitor circuits, and some bug or leak in the Forth code that
occasionally crashes the imager which has begun to show up more often
and less predictably now that we leave the instrument running all the
time between dark runs.<br>
<br>

The scientific requirements document states the design goals of the
instrument, and we have some of the data to see how well those goals
are met.<br>
<br>

There are requirements on the FWHM across the array for a given
free-air seeing and on the magnitude of a 5-sigma point source in all
5 bandpasses, but these are difficult to assign entirely to the imager
since they depend so heavily on the imager quality delivered by the
telescope.  It is clear that we have to be sure that the alignment of
the detectors in the focal plane is not a significant contribution to
the image widths either from focus mismatch or distortion.<br>
<br>

There is a QE/throughput requirement specified on the minimum number
of electrons that the imager should measure from a 20th magnitude
object, and that is straightfoward to look at.  The requirements are:
1300 e- in u', 9000 e- in each of r' and g', 6500 e- in i' and 1500 e-
in z'; these are 75% of the predicted values.  The initial flux
calibration done by the reduction pipelines is output as the flux in
DN that would be measured from a 20th magnitude object in each frame
in each detector.  From the reduction of some data taken in February
2000 and multiplying by the gains to get electrons, the mean value for
this 20th magnitude flux parameter for each CCD is listed below.  The
dispersion around this mean is negligible.<br>

<h3><FONT size=3>Work To Do </FONT>    </h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>

The PLC interface to the optical bench control is well underway and
will be commissioned as part of the MCP-controlled instrument change.
The direct gauge reading of the pressure to one dewar's bellows gives
anyone working with the new interface a double-check that the optical
benches are in the correct configuration to safely move the instrument
and/or the telescope.  This should make it possible to debug the new
optical bench control system with minimum chance of damage to the
instrument.<br>
<br>

The noise problem in CCD u2 and the source of the microprocessor
crashes need to be understood and fixed as soon as possible.  <br>
<br>

We are still finding little details that need to be worked out in the
monitoring system, though it has worked quite well and done its job of
saving the instrument from its builders on more than one occasion.  We
have twice now had the camera shut itself off and warm up, taking it
out of commission for several days, for an error that went away before
it could do any harm.  The chiller and pumps that send water-glycol to
the heat exchangers in the instrument are not run off a UPS and there
is a delay of many minutes between the loss of utility power at the
observatory and when the generator switches on.  If the
microprocessor's monitor process checks the flow in the coolant lines
in that interval, it will right now declare that a dangerous error
condition exists and allow the watchdog timer to run out and shut down
the instrument.  The micro will announce this fact if asked before the
timer runs out, but the last several power failures have come in bad
weather when no-one who would normally catch the problem was on site.
It will take some time for the instrument to get dangerously hot with
the chiller off so it seems reasonable to give the generator a little
breathing space and change the coolant flow error to be an error only
if there is no coolant flow for some predetermined amount of time.
This should be safe particularly given that so many of the other
errors that cause the imager to shut itself down are also related to
thermal monitoring.<br>

<h3><FONT size=3>Long-Term Robustness </FONT>  </h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT 
size=2>

The primary function of the imager is to produce good data for the
survey, and one piece of monitoring and checkout code that has yet to
be implemented is something that will look at the performance of the
detectors and decide if the camera is giving acceptable data.  We have
access to the statistical information for each frame that is provided
by the on-line analysis code running in the DA system and this would
allow performance monitoring to go on as a normal part of observing.
We could also, if necessary, write special code that looked in detail
at designated bias data and perform some tests.  We know the nominal
readnoise and other characteristics of the detectors and can compare
new data against these to look for any discrepancies.  Automated
procedures for checking the CCD data would make testing the imager
after it was worked on much easier and more reliable, and will
hopefully prevent any data getting to FNAL that later had to be
rejected because of some problem with the instrument.  <br>
<br>

The process by which a new version of the Forth code for the micro is
accepted needs to be specified more concretely, probably by a set of
commands that will exhaustively check the imager's normal functions so
that the observers can be certain that it will be able to take data.
The current procedure is for someone knowledgeable to install the new
firmware and exercise the changes and be available when the imager is
run in case problems are uncovered; hardly a long-term solution to the 
problem.<br>
<br>

Mamoru Doi of the University of Tokyo and some of his colleagues built
a monochrometer to measure and track the absolute quantum efficiency
and other characteristics of the imager as part of the calibration of
Survey photometry.  It is housed on top of the imager's enclosure and
provides a means of illuminating the CCDs to check things like gain
and linearity, though taking the data for such tests is right now very
time-consuming and can only be done sporadically.  Once the
calibration system gives us this detailed information about the
imager's performance it will be incumbent on us to make use of it to
be sure that the instrument takes uniform data over the length of the
Survey.<br>
<br>

The CCDs were originally grouped in independent dewars partly as a
precaution so that a catastrophic problem with the vacuum in one of
the dewars would only effect a subset of the detectors.  However, the
dewars all behaved quite poorly when we tried to leave them evacuated
and the detectors cold for more than about two weeks.  This would have
been unacceptable for Survey operations since the camera can usefully
take data for most of a lunar cycle.  After finally deciding that the
problem was not a leak, an ion pump was installed in the camera last
summer.  It is mounted on a manifold that connects all eight dewars in
the camera and the pump is left on and open to the dewars at all
times.<br>
<br>

The eight dewars are now all part of the same, much larger vacuum
system, and the ion pump turns out to have altered its characteristics
enough that we need to go back and make sure that it is as we want it
and fix it where necessary.  It is possible that we trap in the getter
and on the cold outside of the LN2 resevoirs quite a lot of the debris
that we want to take out with the ion pump.  If enough gas remains in
the dewars there is significant danger to the CCDs as the instrument
warms up, since the CCDs remain cold long after the LN2 resevoirs and
the getter come back to room temperature and release all the gas they
collected while they were cold.  The return to room temperature can be
controlled to eliminate danger to the CCDs, but the instrument was
designed to be safe when it is turned off unattended so that the
microprocessor's control of the watchdog timer can be used to respond
to dangerous error conditions.  We need to be sure that it is not now
just as dangerous for the instrument to turn itself off.<br>

<h3><FONT size=3>Maintenance </FONT>  </h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P><FONT size=2>

The imager needs a new full 180L dewar every 24 to 36 hours.  Things
like the 40psi supply pressure and vacuum for the optical bench motion
are checked as part of setup for normal observing, and can be
maintained by the daystaff or by the observers if necessary.<br>
<br>

If it turns out that running for long periods with the ion pump on
leaves a substantial amount of gas trapped in the instrument, then it
will be necessary to warm up the imager during full moon and put it on
the vacuum pump to clean it up.  This is somewhat complicated by the
fact that it can only be done with the imager on the back of the
telescope, immobilizing it for of order 24 hours.<br>
<br>

The vacuum-jacketed lines need to be pumped when they begin to reduce
the efficiency of LN2 transfer.  It looks like it will have to be done
three or four times per year.<br>
<br>

We will have to decide what to do about changing the getter in the
dewars now that the ion pump is installed.  Previously it looked like
it would have to be changed once a year during the summer monsoon
season.  <br>
<br>

It is expected that any in-depth repair or maintenance work on the
imager will be done by its builders with support from the Survey staff
at APO.<br>
