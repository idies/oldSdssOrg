<P><B>IOP</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Imager Observing Program (IOP) is code that runs
on the host DA machines, is built on the DA system software "astroda",
and the survey standard software "astrotools."&nbsp; If astroda is the
code to see the window that the PT-VME link provides on the VME crates,
IOP is the code to see what the instruments choose to reveal of themselves,
and to coerce them, and all the other subsystems necessary (e.g, the telescope)
into taking high quality data. It&nbsp; has the task of integrating all
the other subsystems into a working whole.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>IOP has three different layers of functionality: 1) common
code for driving the Fermilab DA systems and Princeton camera electronics,
2) special purpose code for driving the individual instruments (IOP, SOP,
MOP), and 3) system-wide monitoring and warning/error display code.</FONT></UL>
<B>Common Layer</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The base layer of IOP deals with the common elements
of the instruments.&nbsp; The MT, the twin spectrographs, and the imager
all feature Princeton camera electronics, and in particular the Forth microprocessor
camera controller.&nbsp; Furthermore, all instruments are read out into
Fermilab data acquisition systems.&nbsp; This layer of code implements
the camera communication software and the DA/camera initialization routines.
The common layer allows reboots of the DA and camera, reading of camera
communications, and construction of CCD logs. Included in the common layer
are the base commands: goStare and goDrift, which configure the cameras
and DA systems for data taking. It allows communication with various devices,
like the Telescope Control Computer (TCC) and the Motion Control Processor
(MCP), and includes&nbsp; fast telnet code. Another common layer feature
is the polling of the DA crates to find untransferred gang files, and in
the case of the MT and spectrographs, staring frames.</FONT></UL>
<B>The Instrument Layer</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All three instruments have their own special tasks that
need doing. For example, driving the imager requires the focus loop, driving
the spectrographs needs a guider, and driving the MT requires talking to
a completely different telescope. We have chosen to package all of this
code as subdirectories in the main IOP code. This at least has the virtue
of minimizing the number of packages one has to work on. MOP and SOP are
then IOP plus special purpose scripts.&nbsp; One can perhaps refer to them
collectively as [sim]OP.</FONT></UL>
<B>The Monitor Layer</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The monitor layer is called ``the server.'. IOP attempts
to monitor the state of all subsystems necessary for acquiring data of
high quality.&nbsp; The server monitors the cameras, the nodes and tape
drives of the DA, the TCC output, the MCP, the interlocks, the focus loop,
and various measures of data quality, e.g., sky brightness. To give a sense
of scale, we monitor all 59 CCDs in the survey simultaneously, each of
which has 100 quantities to measure.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We perform this task by turning the server shell into
a "poor man's" real time system.&nbsp; We have created a job scheduling
loop using the Tcl/Tk after command.&nbsp; This scheduler invokes a procedure
periodically, with features to catch errors and send them either to murmur
or to stdout. There are commands to see the jobs in the scheduler loop.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Each subsystem gets a handler, a procedure for asking
the subsystem about state, health and error conditions. First, this involves
communications. We have six different communications methods: 1) telnet
to a subsystem and query, which is how most subsystems work; 2) telnet
to a subsystem and parse an ASCII data stream, which is how our TCC works,
and which we suggest should be avoided; 3) parse an ASCII file as it grows,
as we do for the murmur log while looking for warning and error messages
from the&nbsp; VME crates; 4) interpret binary UDP packets as we do from
the MCP reporting of the interlock system; 5) querying the status pools
of the DA; and 6) reading gang files to extract quality assurance information
from them.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Once we have received state from the subsystem we build
two arrays: the data and the error arrays. All status information we put
into the data array, named for example cameraData. All error state information
we put into the error array, e.g. cameraError. These TCL arrays provide
a common ``blackboard'' for routines to access.&nbsp; Our conventions is
to allow the data arrays to grow with time but to reset the error arrays
each time the error state is queried. This works well if the the instrument
maintains its own error state and clears it when the condition disappears
and works less well for single error reports, as come for instance from
the DA.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We replicate the blackboard in the client graphical state
display. This is done by using TCL-DP ability to send and receive UDP packets.
The packeteer code registers clients. For each client and each data and
error array, the "packeteer" diffs the array, transforms the array into
a list,&nbsp; sends the list as a single UDP packet. The "unpacketeer"
collects the packet and remakes the array.</FONT></UL>
<B>The Watcher</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The watcher is our graphical state display code. Formally,
IOP depends on Watcher; in particular, the special purpose code that ties
IOP to the DA host machines is absent in Watcher, which depends only on
astrotools and tcldp.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The unpacketeer collects the packet and remakes the array,
checking the name of the incoming array, and fires the appropriate&nbsp;
mapping routine, to map the error array into a bit map. The bit map is
carried in a hierarchal tree array structured parallel to the graphical
interface.&nbsp; All error codes on a given tree and layer of the hierarchy
must be unique and then they may be OR'd together to determine which part
of the graphical interface is to be painted red. The uniqueness of the
bit also allows clearing of the error as the observer sees it and acknowledges
it.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The graphical status display is that of a hierarchical
tree. On the top layer is a set of nine ``LED''s, all must be green for
successful high quality data to be taken. Each LED is the top layer of
a hierarchy. At each layer of the hierarchy, the bits of the error masks
of the error map of the levels one below are summed; if the sum is 1 or
greater the graphical unit is painted red. At layers below the top LED
there are panels showing all of the devices or components. This layer either
shows the errors associated with the device, or the status of the device,
depending of which type of mouse click. At the leaf status entries, one
can usually click the name of the status and receive a plot of the quantity
since the start of the day.</FONT></UL>
<B>IOP: Driving the imaging camera</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The driving of the imaging camera itself has several
special&nbsp; requirements.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We have code to determine the optimal rotator angle and
CCD clocking rate using a new technique called "Lskip". This reduces the
time to find these parameters down to 10 minutes or so, from the half hour
or more from our previous and more primitive techniques.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>There is code to tell determine how to run the telescope
along the Survey scans. The TCC itself knows nothing about Survey scans;
we must compute, from a given starting time or RA, the correct position
to slew to, the angle away from RA which to rotate, and the velocity vectors
along RA and Dec at which to scan.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We must maintain good focus. We bring over the gang files,
which contain simple real time reductions of the data, including analysis
of the images on the focus chips. We use the information in the gangs to
drive a simple PID loop to control the secondary; we call this the focus
loop. The SOP guider is built around these same tools.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>We must check whether at the end of the night there remain
images on the DA pool disks that have not been written to tape, and if
so, we must write them.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Downstream pipelines need the bias vector that code in
IOP generates from a bias drift, the bad column map that IOP can produce
from staring frames, and the myriad of bookkeeping files that IOP generates,
from headers through&nbsp; report files. IOP is the source.</FONT></UL>
<B>Current Status</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>IOP is fully functional. There is a set of enhanced goals
related to increasing survey efficiency that remain to be coded, and of
course a bug list.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>During this commissioning period we are discovering new
and interesting error paths in this code. We expect this, and expect that
new error paths will get rarer as time goes on.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The [sim]OPs are not very user friendly, and the documentation
is limited to very high level papers and low level help strings. We have
instead invested our time in personal training.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Development and maintenance are in the hands of the remote
developers. Over the long term, the best course is to incorporate one or
more observers in light maintenance. Only this way can they gain the confidence
and skill to modify what is, in the end, their tools to do the survey to
their own needs.</FONT></UL>
