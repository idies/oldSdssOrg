<P><B>Description</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The purpose of the interlock system is to lower the risk
of personnel injury and to protect the telescope, instruments, and&nbsp;
related equipment near the telescope. The function of the interlock system
is to monitor telescope behavior and inhibit unsafe actions. The initial
requirements were developed from Steve Bracker’s hazard analysis and input
from collaborating institutions. The interlock system requirements were
reviewed and accepted at the November 1996 SDSS Installation Task Force
meeting, then further reviewed and modified at the April 1997 SDSS Controls
&amp; Interlocks Review held near Fermilab. The current performance specifications
for the Telescope Motion Control Interlock System can be found in the document
"Technical Requirements and Performance Specifications for the 2.5-Meter
Telescope", available on the web at <A

under <I>Requirements and Specifications</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Some of the key system elements included a modular system
design, easy to repair or replace components, the ability to quickly bypass
a failed component, and a redundant design topology. The redundant design
topology has been implemented with a two level design philosophy. The Low
Level, or Level 2,&nbsp; Interlocks are critical motion control interlocks
implemented completely in hardware. The High Level, or Level 1, Interlocks
are complex interlocks implemented with an industry standard programmable
logic controller and networked I/O sub-system. To assist the observers
in determining the state of the interlock system a graphical display system
has been developed in TCL/TK by Dennis Nicklaus and later upgraded by Robert
Lupton. This allows the observers to check the real time interlock system
status from any X-Terminal. The graphical display system, along with logic
diagrams that are located in hard-copy form in a binder near the telescope,
allow the observers to quickly identify problems and view the state of
the system.</FONT></UL>
<B>Current State</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The motion control interlock system was final tested
on December 11-13, 1999.&nbsp; System testing was accomplished by causing
a known system violation and monitoring for the correct response. The final
test results can be found in the document "SDSS Telescope Motion Interlock
System Final Test Report", available on the web at <A HREF="http://tdpc01.fnal.gov/sdss/project.htm">http://tdpc01.fnal.gov/sdss/project.htm</A>&nbsp;
under <I>Documentation</I>.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Motor capstan slip detection and telescope velocity limits
remain to be installed and tested. The design is complete and printed circuit
boards are being manufactured. Design testing at Fermilab is expected to
begin in early May with installation at APO tentatively scheduled for mid-June.
The hooks into the interlock system are complete and have been tested.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Building motion interlocks have been implemented within
the interlock system but have not been wired to the building. The connection
of these interlocks is pending a lightning protection review.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Instrument change interlocks have been installed to support
manual instrument change operations. The hardware necessary for automatic
instrument change operations has been installed. The configuration of the
interlocks for automatic instrument change operations is expected by summer.</FONT></UL>
<B>Long Term Robustness and Maintenance</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The majority of the components used in the interlock
system for the 2.5m telescope have been chosen from the components used
in the personnel protection systems at Fermilab. Long term robustness and
reliability is not expected to be a problem for the duration of the survey.
The required maintenance is anticipated to be routine system testing and
validation at 6 to 12 month intervals.</FONT></UL>
