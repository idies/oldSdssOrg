<P><B>Functionality</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The Telescope Control Computer (TCC) is a DEC Alpha running
VMS. The TCC programs were written by Russell Owen (University of Washington)
and are essentially identical to those used to control the APO 3.5m telescope.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>The TCC performs the following functions:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Converts positions specified in e.g. (ra, dec) into (az,
alt, rotation)</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Controls the 2.5m's motion by means of sets of PVT (Position,
Velocity, Time) triplets, specifying the desired position and velocity
of the telescope at the specified time. These PVTs are sent to the MCP.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Controls the 2.5m's optics, allowing for deflections and
responding to requests for piston motion of the secondary</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The Motion Control Processor (MCP) is a MV162 processor running
vxWorks sharing a VME backplane with a number of other boards:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>An </FONT><TT>MEI</TT><FONT SIZE=-1> board to control the
telescope's axes (az, alt, rotator) and read the fiducials. This MEI board
is responsible for the actual PID control of the axes</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>A number of <I>Industry Pack</I> boards to interface with
the programmable logic processor that controls e.g. the flat field lamps
and the brakes</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>A second MV162 (The Telescope Monitor Processor, TPM) responsible
for logging the telescope's status</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>More <I>Industry Pack</I> boards to read e.g. the position
of the mirror activators</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The MCP is responsible for:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Translating motion commands from the TCC's PVTs to commands
that the MEI can understand</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Accepting and implementing requests from the TCC or engineering
menu to e.g. set the brakes, or reset the amplifiers</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Accepting and acting upon commands from the user-level programs
(IOP and SOP) to e.g. turn on flat field lamps</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Interpreting the true positions of the axes, as revealed
by crossing fiducial marks, and making appropriate allowances for errors</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Reading the state of the interlocks system; the axis positions
voltages, currents, and other state; and the state of other components
such as the flat field screen. This information is made available to the
<TT>TPM</TT> via shared memory in the VME crate, and to other interested
parties via UDP packets.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Maintaining a log of what it's doing</FONT></LI>
</UL>
<B>Status</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Of these systems,</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The TCC is fully functional</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The TPM logging is functional, although there are still some
minor issues to be addressed</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The MCP is reasonably stable, although there is some missing
functionality and some outstanding problems. For example,</FONT></LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>It is intended that the MCP be able to control instrument
changes but this has not yet been implemented.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>On-the-fly corrections to the encoder positions are implemented,
but disabled pending further testing</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Offsets of -30' in alt take the telescope out of closed loop</FONT></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=-1>There are some mysterious failures and hangs</FONT></LI>
</UL>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=-1>When the MCP works, as it almost always does, its performance
is very good. It is not clear whether the intermittent axis-motion problems
will be solvable without a total rewrite of the code that handles PVT commands
from the TCC.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I believe that all of these systems are maintainable,
although the long-term owner of the MCP code has not been identified.&nbsp;
Documentation for the TPM and (especially) the MCP is seriously lacking.</FONT>
