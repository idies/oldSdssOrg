<P><B>General SDSS Site Operations Responsibilities</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Past:&nbsp; Site construction and infrastructure development,
on-site staff buildup and training, receive deliverables and support integration
and commissioning.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Present:&nbsp; Finish receipt and integration of operational
systems, provide direct technical and admin support to remote and visiting
Project staff during commissioning and handovers, complete recruitment
and training, capture and systematize engineering and operational documentation,
start survey data acquisition.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Future:&nbsp; Conduct Survey observing and spectroscopic
plug plate processing, maintain SDSS facilities and site infrastructure,
ramp-down SDSS operations as Survey nears completion.</FONT></UL>


<P><B>Site Physical Description</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>APO located in the Sacramento Mountains at 2800 meters
elevation near Sunspot, New Mexico, near the National Solar Observatory
facilities at Sacramento Peak.&nbsp; The APO campus sits on 7 acres of
land leased from the U.S. Forest Service.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Observing facilities include the SDSS 2.5-meter survey
telescope, a 0.5-meter telescope which is used to calibrate survey photometry,
a</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>3.5-meter telescope used for general visible and IR imaging
and spectroscopy, and a 1-meter telescope owned by NMSU.&nbsp; The site
also</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>contains operations and support systems, buildings, and
dormitories. 23,000 sq. ft. under roof (about half for SDSS).</FONT></UL>


<P><B>On-site Staffing and Organization</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Site operations staff comprised of about 25 full- or
part-time individuals who conduct the observing and provide technical and</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>administrative support to the site, telescopes, and instruments.
Many of the support staff divide their time between the SDSS and 3.5-m</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>projects; the SDSS observers, engineers and technicians
specialize in SDSS.&nbsp; About 17 FTEs work on-site on SDSS, plus a few
"commuters" from SDSS institutions.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>[org chart and staff profile to be attached]</FONT></UL>


<P><B>Off-site Project Resources and Interfaces</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Scientific and engineering support is provided to survey
operations through arrangements with SDSS partner institutions.&nbsp; During</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>construction and commissioning, support has been ~3000
person-days/year at the site, plus remote support furnished by e-mail</FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=-1>or telephone.&nbsp; This is tapering down.</FONT></UL>


<P><B>Operational Notes and Plans</B>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><U>Commissioning Support and Handover</U> - Operations
staff work closely with off-site and visiting project staff during pre-ship,
installation, check out, commissioning.&nbsp; This helps to get jobs done
plus operational perspective value added, with critical information transferred
to site staff.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><U>Observing</U> - 2.5-m Telescope will be on the sky
whenever possible during dark (and grey?) time.&nbsp; Operational models
for efficient observing, safety, and skill-mix require 2 Observers per
night (requires minimum of 6 Observers total) for Survey observing, and
possibly 1 Observer plus engineer for engineering time.&nbsp; Observers
are scientists/technologists and assume the role of PIs for the daily/nightly
runs on the telescopes.&nbsp; Activities include running site planning
tools, participating in daily telecon with off-site SDSS scientists, performing
nightly evaluation of data products, making tactical observing decisions,
helping coordinate plug-plate staging, and writing and sending observing
logs.&nbsp; Observers are expected to participate in SDSS science programs,
and will be assigned occasional TDY at FNAL to work with data processing
scientists (and vice versa).</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1><U>Photometric Telescope</U> - In operation during all
survey observing, probably about 0.5 FTE at site, TBD.&nbsp; In steady
state, it is expected that the PT will require minimal nighttime operational
support.&nbsp; During the first year or two, the site oberving staff will
need to be augmented by an observer furnished by JHU.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>

<P><U><FONT SIZE=-1>Plug Plates</FONT></U><FONT SIZE=-1> - FNAL provides
drilling specifications to UWashington, where the plates are fabricated
and then shipped to APO.&nbsp; APO manages receipt, processing, storage,
and inventory at site. On-site activities include plate database maintenance,
plate receipt and storage, Q/A monitoring, staging, plugging and unplugging,
fiber mapping, and fiber harness and cartridge use and maintenance.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>
