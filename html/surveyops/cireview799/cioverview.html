<hr>

<p>The controls and interlocks system for the SDSS 2.5m telescope is nearly complete and
commissioning is in progress.&nbsp; At this point, we would like to review the system
implementation and current level of performance, and consider possible refinements. This
will be a follow on to the Controls and Interlocks System Design Review held April 24-25,
1997. </p>

<p>We will devote approximately one day and a half to presentations and discussion.&nbsp;
On the afternoon of the second day the reviewers will meet in executive session to discuss
their findings and prepare recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this executive session,
we will finish the review with a brief close-out meeting during which the reviewers can
highlight their comments and concerns.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Presentations during the review will include the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Telescope Motion Control <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Servo system design <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardware </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Interlocks <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-level interlocks <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High-level interlocks <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motion control processor/interlocks interface </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Telescope Performance Monitor <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each subsystem, the presenters will be asked to address the following topics: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Requirements and specifications <br>
  2) Description of the as-built design <br>
  3) Status of the implementation <br>
  4) Technical difficulties <br>
  5) Performance <br>
  6) Possible changes and refinements <br>
  7) Reliability and serviceability <br>
  8) Plans for completion <br>
  9) Failure modes and safety issues <br>
  10) Operations documentation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presentation materials will be made available on the web prior to the review. </p>

<p>The reviewers are: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patrick Wallace (Rutherford Laboratory) <br>
  Alan Schier (Consultant) <br>
  Jeffrey Percival (University of Wisconsin) <br>
  Ed Bell (NOAO) <br>
  Jeff&nbsp; Peterson (CMU) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the issues we would like the reviewers to address are the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1) Does the design as implemented meet the performance requirements? </p>
  <p>2) Given the commissioning experience could any of the requirements be modified without
  compromising the objectives of the survey? </p>
  <p>3) Are there technical changes and improvements that would improveperformance or
  operational effectiveness? </p>
  <p>4) Does the implementation lend itself to safe and reliable operation? <br>
  &nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the review a summary report of the findings and recommendations will be
circulated to the reviewers for comment.&nbsp; The completed summary report, together with
comments and action items, will be posted on the web. </p>
