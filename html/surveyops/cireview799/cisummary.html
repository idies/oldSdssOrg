<P>1. During commissioning of the system, the project needs a few capable
engineers dedicated to the task who spend most of their time on site. These
engineers need equipment, long periods of access, and technical support.

<P>2. A larger building is vital in order to allow efficient debug and
testing of the telescope.

<P>3. The project needs an on-site system engineer to prioritize and coordinate
the work necessary to bring the telescope to an operational state. In the
sense intended here, a systems engineer is a technical person.

<P>4. The project needs a project manager and a project management plan.

<P>5. The noise in the various sensors must be addressed immediately. In
particular, work on the servos is a much lower priority until the noise
in the axis encoders is eliminated.

<P>6. The variety of the computing hardware and software systems is of
concern. The project must plan for the case where a critical person is
not longer available. This plan should include instructions for rebuilding
executables. These instructions must be periodically exercised by the person
who is responsible at the time.

<P>7. It appears that the requirement for the speed of the azimuth axis
has been misinterpreted. A modest increase in the maximum speed should
be easily feasible with the existing hardware and would dramatically reduce
the size of the zenith blind spot.

<P>8. The source of the axis runaways must be found and corrected.

<P>9. An axis over speed detection interlock must be implemented.

<P>10. The design of the TPM and utility software should be internally
reviewed, decided upon, and documented. The implementation should then
proceed quickly.

<P>11. The project needs to generate and implement a policy regarding the
bypassing of interlocks.

<P>12. It appears that there is some risk to the telescope and primary
mirror in the event that the telescope runs into a hard stop or the windscreen
at zero degrees elevation.

<P>13. A slip detection system should be implemented. A procedure for recovery
from a slip fault should be decided upon and formalized.
