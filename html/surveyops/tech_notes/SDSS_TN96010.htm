<p>This report summarizes the results from performing a crude test to 
determine the starting torque required to begin rotation of the SDSS 
Instrument Rotator.  The disc was rotated manually by pulling on a 100 
lb. capacity spring scale attached to the rotator at a radius of 36 
inches from the center of the disc.  The spring scale was checked with a 
50 lb. weight, resulting in a measured weight of 50.5 lbs.  The scale 
had a mechanical stop, limiting the maximum measurable weight to 108 
lbs.  The rotator motor capstan was verified to not be contacting the 
surface during the operation.  The disc is constrained by a series of 8 
roller assemblies that act to flatten and axially support the disc at 
the outer edge.  The rotator disc is configured with approximately 2100 
lbs. of steel weights, simulating the weight of attached 
instrumentation.</P>

<p>Measurements were made every 10 degrees in the CCW direction facing the 
bottom of the OSS for one full rotation.  Measurements were then made 
every 30 degrees in the CW direction for one full rotation.  Average CW 
and CCW starting torque was found to be in excess of 320 ft-lb, with a 
minimum starting torque of 264 ft-lb, and a maximum starting torque in 
excess of 324 ft-lb.  The maximum starting torque could not be 
accurately measured due to the maximum measurable weight of the scale 
being limited to 108 lbs.  At least 11 of the 49 total measurements were 
in excess of 108 lbs.  At least 3 of these measurements seemed to be 
appreciably more that 108 lbs.  A rough estimate, based on the physical 
exertion of pulling on the scale, would be approximately an additional 
10 lbs. of force needed at these 3 locations.  This would result in a 
maximum starting torque of approximately 350 ft-lb.</P>

<p>The 8 roller assemblies were partially or completely disassembled in 
order to measure the friction contribution of the rotator bearing.  The 
disc was checked to verify that nothing was contacting the outer 
surfaces of the disc, ensuring that the disc was supported only by the 
bearing mount.  The disc was then rotated using the spring scale.  The 
initial pull resulted in a starting torque in excess of 320 ft-lb.  The 
procedure was repeated several times, with the resulting starting 
torques measured at 270 ft-lb.  If several minutes were allowed to 
lapsed, the starting torque would again be in excess of 320 ft-lb.  If 
only  a few seconds lapsed, the starting torque would be 270 ft-lb.  
This observed feature may have impact on the earlier measurements with 
the roller assemblies in place.  This procedure was not performed for a 
full rotation of the disc.  The measurements were made in the CCW 
direction over an angle of approx 30 degrees.</P>

<p>A table of measurements follows:</p>
<p>Note:  The 0 degree reference was defined at the orientation in which an 
arrow drawn on the outer face of the rotator disc was pointing up.  A 
digital protractor was placed on the sides of the rectangular weights 
attached to the disc indicating that the angle made by the 16 in sides 
was 0 degrees (horizontal).  The disc was then rotated CCW from this 
orientation at 10 degree angles for 1 full revolution, then CW at 30 
degree angles back to the original orientation.  The CW rotation was 
interrupted part way due to loosing track of position, rotated CCW back 
to the starting position for rotating CW, then the measurements we 
performed without further interruption.</P>
