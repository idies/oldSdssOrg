<P>An Omega load cell model LCH-5K was used to measure the clamping force produced by the
altitude and azimuth brakes with 80 psi air on the cylinders.  A chart recorder gave
force vs. time.</P>

<P>Cylinder speed controls are used on the engage and disengage ports on the cylinders, and 
these can be adjusted to change the braking time as shown ont he chart readouts.</P>

<P>Maximum brake force was about 1640 pounds.  The coefficient of friction can vary from
0.1 to 0.3 according to the brake pad material and manufacturer.</P>

<P>A digital readout of clamp force vs. time is also shown on chan. 1 of the last chart.</P>

</P>The windbaffle-telescope clamp was also tested as shown in the sketch.  </P>

<P>The clamp housing was fixed to a work bench, and a spring scale used used to pull
on a steel bar which could pivot ont he far end.  The ball bearing ont he clamp swing
arm rolls against the steel bar when the clamp force is exceeded.  The air regulator can be
adjusted to vary the clamp force.  Only two pressures were tried, 10 psi and 20 psi, since 
larger clamp forces are unnecessary and the clamp force will be adjusted after final assembly.</P>

<P>At 10 psi regulator pressure, S=60#, P=110#<BR>
At 20 psi regulator pressure, S=120#, P=219#
