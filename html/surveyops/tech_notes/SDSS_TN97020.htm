<p>This note will try to address some of the problems of designing protection
for the electronics at Apache Point. It may seem very complicated, but
it is not. It is simply a matter of a certain attitude when connecting
things together. It is just as easy to connect things up to reduce the
chance of electrical transient damage as to hook them up in any other way.
In general there is a bonus, since good practice for transient shielding
tends to be good for low noise signal transmission. Correcting bad wiring
practice later generally involves tearing everything apart and starting
over. No one I have advised has ever done this, though they have often
expended more effort than this would have required in various efforts to
reduce noise. They don't take my advice and just find another consultant.

<p>Since not many will wish to ponder the philosophy of lightning protection
we will cut to the chase and list the rules first. If you don't understand
a rule you may wish to read the text.
<UL>
<li>Rule #1 Very Separate Locations should have no conductive path between
them. (See text).<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #2 Everything for Layers 2,3, and 4 should be completely inside
the levels of a Faraday cage. (See text)<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #3 There should be lightning protection on the mains where they
enter the transformer for Layer 2.<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #4 The transformer that supplies Layer 2 should have its primary
in Layer 1 and it's secondary in Layer 2. It should be specially selected
to have a good electrostatic shield between the primary and the secondary,
and should stand a high surge voltage between primary and secondary. The
electrostatic shield should be connected to the outside of Layer 2.<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #5 The motor generator set that connects Layer 3 to Layer 4 should
be specially selected to minimize the chance that an arc can follow the
shaft.<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #6 Fiber optic cables (and other non conductors) entering Level
2 should be coverd with a close fitting shield for 20 diameters. The shield
should be connected to the outside of Layer 2.<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #7 There should be no "holes" in Layer 2 larger than 1/2". Particular
attention should be paid to long slits - as in door openings. Metal tape
or finger stock should be used to minimize the energy that can get through
such a long slit.<BR><BR>

<li>Rule #8 Special attention should be paid to the fiber optics cables
entering Layer 4. I would propose two layers of protection at this point.
I will be happy to discuss how this might be done. At the very least, the
shield at this entry should be very long. 200 diameters and several layers
of braid.
</ul>

<P><U>General Philosophy</U></P>

<p>My general idea of lightning protection is one of layers. One hopes
to attenuate the problem at each layer. Direct strikes are going to kill
some stuff, because they can vaporize a lot of metal. One tries to offer
some metal as a sacrifice to Thor that is expendable. The camera should
have the most protection as it is the most valuable.

<p><U>Layer #0</U>:  In my tour of Apache Point, I did not observe any lightning rods. I
would put up a few towers with lightning rods. I am not up to date on lightning
theory, but I recall that lightning rods work by both bleeding off the
charge and as a preferred strike location. In any case, if lightning is
going to strike (it is, a lot, at Apache Point), then I would like to know
where it is going to strike (usually) and be prepared. This means that
one gives it a nice path to ground that does not include any CCD chips.
Note that power companies know and understand this and string a ground
wire above their transmission lines. Several wires strung along the path
between the 3.5 meter, the control room, and the 2.5 meter would probably
get hit first and save other things. The MT should have a preferred place
for lightning to strike.


<p><U>Layer #2</U>:   Star construction. All electrical wiring between objects that
communicate with each other should be wired in a star. This is a problem
in that I suspect this had not been considered and has already been violated.
I assume that the control room and the 2.5 meter location already have
separate transformer feeds from primary power. So we must consider the
two as "Very Separate Locations".

<p>Rule #1:  Very Separate Locations should have no conductive path between
them. OK, how do we connect "Very Separate Locations" if we must. First
this is where we can use fiber optics. I would bury them in a conductive
conduit. As in the ASCII art below:

<p>The conduits from each side are tied to their respective "grounds" at
their two star ground ends. One hopes that a lightning strike that finds
the conduit travels over the surface to the star end that it strikes and
does not arc across the gap. The cables inside see greatly reduced electric
fields. I would insulate the whole mess from "ground" by placing it in
plastic pipe or some such insulator. 

<p>At each location we then have a "star"
shielding structure. OK, we can't do this because our buildings are already
grounded at many locations. So we have a: 

<p><u>Layer #1</U>: This is the building
and its structure. It is grounded in many places. Because of this and the
varying conductivities of its sturcture, a lightning strike will cause
large potentials to appear between different points. It can serve as an
attenuator if properly used. Layer #1 completely encloses Layer #2. Layer
#1 is leaky, in that it has openings and windows and the like. It does
serve as a first layer electrostatic shield. It is recommended that in
order to get the full benefit of having a Layer #1 that Layer #2 be completely
within it. 

<p>Layer #2 is thus fabricated within the structure of Layer #1.
It should be a completely enclosed Faraday cage with an inside and an outside.

<p>Rule #2:  Everything should be completely inside a Faraday cage. 

<p>Inside is
the secondary of the feed transformer. The electrostatic shield of the
transformer is is connected to the outside of Layer #2. This is a good
point for the single connection from layer #2 to ground. The electrical
code will require this ground point anyway. It will be tricky to sort out
what is "inside" and what is "outside" of layer #2. The code will require
carying a "green wire" ground around inside the conduit of layer #2. This
just makes sure that everything is connected together and that there are
no breaks in the conduit. This is so you don't get killed grabbing hold
of the conduit when a wire breaks loose inside and touches it. 

<p>OK, it will be hard to float Layer #2 everywhere. One pictures a main 
entrance box that is tied to the ground rod with conduit running off in 
all directions (but in a star). The key thing is that everything is "inside". </P>

<p>Let us suppose that the "Something Else" in the illustration above is a
position sensor on the telescope. It's wires should be inside a shield
that is connected to the enclosure formed by the equipment rack. It should
be completely enclosed by a shield. 

<p>Note that one tries to carry the "star"
concept everywhere. Usually this is difficult without a lot of pre-planning.
Consider a string of racks A, B, and C out from the entrance box. Consider
also D, E, and F on another star string out from the entrance box. One
would like to restrict connections between racks to cases like D to E,
E to F, and A to B, etc.. One really wants to avoid connections like A
to D and B to F, etc.. These form "ground loops" that are really not so
bad if the signals are properly carried between the racks. Note that in
the case of a lightning strike nearby, there can be a large field enclosed.
These can induce high currents in such a ground loop. This is OK if the
conduction path is perfect as the currents then go on the surface of the
enclosure and signals do not penetrate inside. But a less that perfect
ground bond can create large potential differences in such a case, and
thus high electric fields appear "inside". Better to keep the star connection.
If one wants to connect C to F then the best path is really inside the
conduit from C to B to A to entrance box to D to E to F. 

<p><u>Layer #3</U>:</p> The problem
with Layer #2 is that it connects (electrically) to the outside world and
all the terrible things attracted by the power line. There are special
transformer designs (like the membrane transformer) that have near perfect
electrostatic shielding. We probably have to live with what we have, so
one has to expect terrible things to come in on the mains. This can include
a lightning strike arcing across from primary to secondary and thus getting
inside the enclosure of Layer #2. This will then find it's way to the enclosure
of layer #2 to find ground. It will fry whatever is in its path. We can
stand for this to happen to most things, the camera is another matter.
We thus put the camera inside Layer #4, which is inside Layer #3 which
is inside Layer #2, which is inside Layer #1 which is protected by Layer
#0. 

<p>The problem with layer #3 is getting power there. We do not want any
penitrations in layer #3 that might be a path for lightning. This poses
a special problem for the camera which I will discuss later. The easy way
to do this is with a motor generator set. We have a motor which is outside
layer #3 in layer #2. A shaft from the motor is the penetration through
layer #3 where it drives a generator inside layer #3. Resist the temptation
to bring out control wires. When the power line arcs over the windings
we want it to see the "ground" of layer #2 first. Thus one wants a squirrel
cage motor. No field windings to arc over to the shaft which might make
a path inside layer #3. 

<p>Layer #4 is inside layer #3 and contains the camera.
The generator inside Layer #3 drives the primary of the power supplies.
These should have good electrostatic shields that are bonded to layer #4.
The primary to secondary insulation of the power supply transformers is
then the penultimate protection. The final layer of protection should then
be passive clamps on all the critical voltages. 

<p>Alas, the camera chips
are exposed to the sky, and thus are subject to the electric fields associated
with a nearby strike. The cage of the telescope structure helps, as it
will tend to screen the electric field transient. Still, by its very nature
it is a big capacitor to the sky. This is why it is important to put clamps
on all the critical CCD leads. I wold put diodes on all the clock and signal
lines to the supply voltages. There is not much more that one can do. For
my own camera design, I have placed the switches that form the clock signals
inside the camera head. I bring the signals that drive the switches in
on diode clamped leads. I bring the DC clock levels in on well filtered
leads. While the CCD chip is exposed to the sky, it only sees it through
the length of a camera lens. Lots of metal and a long path. So I try to
practice what I preach. I think Jim Gunn's design is similar, except for
all that capacity to the sky. Just some thoughts on protection.
