<P>During instrument exchange operations, errors in telescope altitude and rotator position translate into essentially East-West errors in the position of the opening in the spectrograph which must accept the fiber cartridge slit head.</p>

<p>The original specifications called for a +/-0.2<sup>o</sup> tolerance in the altitude and rotator positions.  This was changed to a tolerance of +/- 0.05<sup>o</sup> for altitude axis position and +/-0.1<sup>o</sup> for rotator position.  This change enabled coupling of the cartridge kinematic mounts but offers too little room for error in the slit head to spectroscope opening.</p>

<p>A change to +/-0.05<sup>o</sup> in rotator error is requested to permit safe instrument transfer.  The attached scale drawing illustrates the effect of the various tolerances.<p>

<p>Keep in mind that the error in telescope position is effectively doubled because the cartridge could be at the opposite extreme position.  The drawing shows the slit head at exactly the same error as the telescope which is impossible due to tolerances in the many components involved in the location of the cartridge.  Therefore, less space will, in reality, be available than shown.</p>

<p>Insert image of 4 drawings and get a drawing for the last image.</p>


<p>The addition of the plastic washer insignificantly reduces the effective spring constant.</p>
