<P>On Oct. 12, 1997 the SDSS instrument lift was tested with a 1400 Lb. load.
The system was cycled many times and no problems were observed. The reported
"vibration" was caused by a dry piston rod on the hydraulic cylinder, oiling
the rod lightly with oil solved the problem.</P>

<P>The system pressure is set at 760 PSI at the pump with the relief valve 
setting slightly  higher to avoid "teasing" the relief valve with minor 
pressure changes. Only one pressure is used for both directions and for all
instruments lifted.</P>

<P>Except for some Questions about the electrical connection to the MCP, the
lift is ready for use. Dan Long and Steve Bastian were shown how to operate
the system using the manual control.</P>
