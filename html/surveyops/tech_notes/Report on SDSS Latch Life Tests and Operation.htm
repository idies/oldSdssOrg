      <H3>Introduction:</H3>
      <P>The instrument latches on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Telescope hold 
      up the CCD camera and are required to be 100% reliable over the lifetime 
      of the Survey, a design life of 10,000 latch cycles. To achieve this 
      reliability the latches were tested in the laboratory using a programmable 
      controller, a fixture to load the latches, and an air supply to simulate 
      conditions at the telescope. The test latch was tested to 8000 cycles at 
      room temperature and 2000 cycles in a freezer to simulate winter on the 
      mountain. This ratio of cold to warm testing was thought to match the 
      likely ratio on the mountain given fewer observable nights in winter due 
      to weather. 
      <P>This report summarizes the results of that testing and what was learned 
      during the testing process. Ultimately, six latches were delivered to APO 
      that had all the final design changes incorporated, were tested and found 
      reliable. The original log book of the testing is available through SDSS 
      management. 
      <P>AutoCAD drawings of the latch and test fixture are referenced in this 
      report. They are in DWF format, which requires the Whip! plug-in for 
      Netscape and Internet Explorer, available at <A

      that may be inaccessible or indistinct in the jpeg image. Using the "back" 
      button on your browser returns the reader to the report. 
      <H3>Overview of Test Plan:</H3>
      <P>Testing of the instrument latches happened in three major phases. The 
      first phase was room temperature (referred to as "warm") testing on the 
      camera simulator. The second major phase was cold testing of the latch on 
      the camera simulator in a freezer. The third phase was actually not a life 
      test of the latch as much as it was a life test of the stirrup mechanism 
      that supports the plug cartridges. The latches are used to support two 
      completely different pieces of equipment alternately, the CCD camera and 
      the Plug Cartridges. The camera weighs more than the plug cartridges so it 
      loads the latch more heavily and is the main reason for the reliability 
      requirement. The reason for testing the plug cartridge stirrup was to 
      guarantee its reliability so that the survey would not be impacted by 
      problems in this component during cartridge changes. 
      <P>The assembly drawing of the latch is in Figure 1. The fixture that 
      loads the latch by the same mechanism that the camera uses is shown in 
      Figure 2. The fixture used to life test the Plug Cartridge Stirrup is 
      shown in Figure 3.

      <H3>Discussion of Problems Encountered During Testing:</H3>
      <P>A series of problems was encountered and solved all during the latch 
      load testing to end up with the final reliable product. The latch design 
      evolved from the original concept developed at Princeton, and what was 
      first tested was Bartoszek Engineering's redesign of the latch that 
      attempted to recycle as many of the original components as possible. The 
      testing determined that many of the original components were not adequate 
      to achieve the reliability, so they were gradually replaced over the 
      course of testing. What follows is a brief description of the changes that 
      happened due to problems discovered during testing. 
      <H4>Proper Latch Pre-load--Setting and Maintaining</H4>
      <P>The load that the latch hook sees upon latching was entirely determined 
      by the amount of preload a stack of belleville washers was put under by a 
      1/2-20 bolt in the test fixture. It was originally thought that the load 
      could be set with the latch in the unlatched position, but this was later 
      found to be incorrect because the stirrup in the camera simulator could be 
      positioned by two small screws in the bottom which took away the 
      relationship between the loads in the latched and unlatched configuration. 
      The most important thing to realize about the latches is that they are 
      fixed stroke devices. They must exert enough force to change from the 
      latched to the unlatched state, but the stroke that the hook goes through 
      from one state to the other is always fixed. Because of this, the force on 
      the latch has to be set by adjusting the preload in the springs with the 
      latch in the latched position. 
      <P>The preload was intended to be between 700 and 800 pounds to make the 
      latches hold three times the weight of the camera. The set of the springs 
      was determined by the Belleville spring test mentioned above. Once the 
      correct spring compression had been determined by the Instron test all the 
      latches were tested with a compression of .130 inches, corresponding to a 
      load of 700 lbs. 800 pounds was doable, but required more air pressure 
      than 95 psi and was not thought necessary. 
      <P>A perrenial problem that occurred throughout the test was that the 
      1/2-20 bolt would periodically loosen from the vibrations, or the 
      belleville springs would wear grooves in the bolt and then get stuck, 
      changing the preload that the latch hook saw. This problem was solved by 
      adequately tightening a lock nut on the 1/2-20 bolt, and by replacing the 
      bolt with a grade 8 one that was hard enough to resist the grooving of the 
      springs wearing on the bolt shank. 
      <H4>Component Material Problems</H4>
      <P>The original guide rollers inside the latch were oil-lite bronze. The 
      oil-lite bronze was discovered to be unable to take the forces of latching 
      and would develop grooves or deformations that eventually caused the latch 
      to jam and misfire. The rollers were all replaced with stainless steel. To 
      reduce friction between the stainless rollers and axles, Glacier DU 
      bushings were introduced between them. Latch forces are high enough to 
      cause plastic deformation of the DU bushings which tends to elongate them, 
      but this was discovered in testing and the bushings were shortened so that 
      they couldn't get long enough to jam in the mechanism. 
      <P>The original latch housings were aluminum. These were replaced with 
      cold drawn steel coated with Wear-Cote Plus CFx to make them corrosion and 
      wear resistant. The latch hooks were originally also coated steel, but the 
      plating flaked off in contact with the pusher roller and the flakes were 
      considered hazardous to the reliability. The hooks were remanufactured 
      from stainless steel. 
      <H4>Component Geometry Problems</H4>
      <P>The latch hook profile was kept the same as the Princeton original 
      during the steel hook testing, but after it was discovered that the 
      profile had sharp edges that were destroying the pusher rollers, they were 
      modified to the current profile to lower forces on the latching mechanism. 

      <H4>Controller Problems</H4>
      <P>Some of the early latch failures could be traced back to insufficient 
      flow of air through the solenoid valves in the controller. These were 
      replaced with larger models that solved this problem. The larger models 
      never needed replacing for the remainder of the testing. 
      <H4>Moisture Problems and Other Air Supply Problems</H4>
      <P>Moisture in the air supply lines became a big problem during testing in 
      the freezer where it would condense and freeze the lines shut. We were 
      eventually forced to switch from using shop air from a compressor to dry 
      nitrogen in bottles ganged together. Another problem with shop air was 
      that the pressure required by the latch was close enough to the limits of 
      the compressor on/off dead band setting that the pressure would drop too 
      low for reliable latching before the compressor would cycle on. This made 
      the latches look unreliable when it was really an air supply problem. We 
      were eventually forced to log the air supply pressure on a chart trace to 
      track this problem down. The gas bottles also solved this problem. 
      <P>After many trials, the conclusion was reached that the latch would 
      never latch reliably significantly below 95 psi. An original design 
      constraint was to operate at 80 psi, but this could not be met. The air 
      system at APO was upgraded and the latches have worked reliably there (at 
      lower pressures than they would operate at in the lab). 
      <P>Another condition that did not lead to problems in the lab, but was 
      thought to be a problem for the camera was that the latching and 
      unlatching were not gentle. A distinct banging was happening at the latch. 
      Eventually, flow restrictors were put on the air cylinder ports to 
      throttle the flow rate down and make the latches move with force but lower 
      speed. 
      <H4>Switch and Mag Sensor Problems</H4>
      <P>Periodically throughout the testing the number of unlatch signals and 
      commands would exceed the number of latch commands. This was thought to be 
      caused by switch bounce in the microswitch that indicated latch hook 
      retraction. This was a problem that came and went and was never completely 
      understood, but did finally go away with the addition of flow restrictors 
      to the air cylinders. It seems to have been mainly associated with the 
      "intermittent" mode of operation of the controller. In "I" mode, the 
      controller turns off the supply of air to the cylinder as soon as it gets 
      a signal from the microswitch that the latch is in the desired state. 
      Before the flow restrictors were put it the speed may have been high 
      enough that the latch hook bounced in and out of contact with the 
      microswitch causing the controller to send more unlatch signals. As long 
      as the number of unlatch commands matched the number of unlatch signals, 
      and same for latch commands and signals, these tests were allowed to be 
      final. 
      <P>A problem associated with the magnetic proximity sensor that indicates 
      the latched state is that it is adjusted and locked into a dovetail groove 
      on the outside of the air cylinder with a small pan head screw. This screw 
      has no means of being locked and did loosen on a couple of occasions. The 
      sensor has been glued in place with RTV on the final latches. 
      <H4>Latch Spring Problems</H4>
      <P>The first latch retraction spring problem that we had was with a spring 
      that had gone many thousands of cycles on the test latch and suddenly the 
      loop on one end cracked off. Metallurgical testing determined that the 
      spring had fatigue failed and the failure could have been caused by a tiny 
      imperfection on the drawn wire that created a stress riser. This was 
      written off as a fluke. It was deemed too expensive to examine every 
      spring with a microscope, and there was too much area hidden inside the 
      coils of the spring to make it worthwhile. A report is available about 
      this failure from Bill Boroski. 
      <P>In October of 1998, Corrector Latch #1 was returned to Fermilab from 
      APO because it would not signal that it was unlatched and the hook stuck 
      out slightly. It was determined that the latch retraction spring had been 
      over stretched. It was kinked and about one and a half coils longer than a 
      new spring. This was a failure that had never happened in the lab, but was 
      traced back to the fact that the retraction springs could move back and 
      forth on the roll pins that hold them in place. It was possible for a 
      spring to move far enough off center that it could be pinched between the 
      latch hook and housing during retraction. The solution was to design some 
      bronze sleeves that would keep the spring centered. A web report is also 
      available about this failure at <I>NEED LINK HERE</I>. 
      <HR align=center width="90%">

      <H3>Abbreviated Summary of Test Results:</H3>
      <P>On 2/18/98, the test latch was cycled at room temperature to 8247 
      cycles with no lost counts. The air pressure was set to 95 psig 
      <P>On 2/20/98, the latch test fixture was installed in the freezer. 
      2/21/98 was when the broken retraction spring was discovered. The test 
      latch was cycled in and out of the freezer after reassembly several times 
      to check for reliability. Pressure definitely needed to be turned up while 
      the test was in the freezer (between 103 and 110 psig). There were several 
      tests with failed latching that were probably due to water in the air 
      lines. 
      <P>By 3/17/98, all changes had been made to run dry nitrogen through the 
      tester in the freezer. Successfully ran 2398 cycles at -18.2 degrees C. 
      <P>The final version of the Plug Cartridge stirrups were tested on 
      10/11/99. They successfully latched and unlatched at least 400 cycles at 
      room temperature. We did not test these cold. 
      <P>The test latch was sent out to APO as a spare, but its housing needs 
      the chamfer cut that all the rest of the latches have. 
      <HR align=center width="90%">

      <H3>Summary of Latch Operating Requirements:</H3>
      <P>The latch needs dry air at 95 psig for room temperature. 
      <P>The reliable operating pressure in the lab was about 105 psig when the 
      temperature was at -18C. 
      <P>The magnetic proximity sensor indicates the latched state. 
      <P>The microswitch on the back of the latch indicates the unlatched state 
      when it is closed.
