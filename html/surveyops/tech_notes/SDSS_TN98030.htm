<P>This report summarizes major accomplishments made by Fermilab people
working on various engineering aspects of the 2.5-meter telescope during
the period from January through March, 1998.</P>

<UL>
<LI>All major design work was completed on the fiber cartridge manipulators.
 Bids were solicited and orders placed for the fabrication of all hardware
components.  Fabrication of many of the components was actually completed
during this quarter.  These items have been subjected to QC inspections and
are now awaiting assembly.  <BR><BR>

<LI>The Fiber Mapper system was delivered to APO and installed in its final
location in the support building.  The system was aligned and tested using
the first fully-assembled production fiber cartridge assembly.  For these
tests, the cartridge was fitted with a prototype plug plate.  The
mechanical system, under computer control, worked very well.  The majority
of the software also worked well.  Some work remains to improve the
triangulation algorithms for determining plate orientation.  Also, there
was still a large variation in fiber throughput as seen by the Mapper
system.  Cylindrical lenses have been procured to convert the illuminator
laser beam from a point to a line source.  It is thought that this may help
reduce the throughput variation.   <BR><BR>

<LI>Assembly and bench-testing of the telescope altitude and azimuth brakes
was completed and the brakes installed onto the telescope.  During
bench-testing, the operation of the brakes was tuned to control the rate at
which the brakes are applied.  Under the current settings, the brakes reach
a clamping force of 1600 pounds in approximately 30 seconds.  The brakes
can be operated manually using a hand-held control pendant.  The brakes
have been wired into the control system and given some software work, will
operate under computer control.  <BR><BR>

<LI>Assembly and bench-testing of the telescope-to-wind-baffle alignment
clamp was completed and the clamp installed between the telescope and wind
baffle.  During operation, the clamp will center the telescope azimuthally
within the wind baffle. Testing has shown that it requires 70 pounds of
force to move the telescope in azimuth.   The maximum alignment force that
the clamp generates has been limited to 200 pounds to ensure proper
operation while limiting the potential for equipment damage should an
obstruction occur between the wind baffle and telescope.  Although the
clamp has been installed, it is not in its final, aligned position.  The
clamp components will be aligned and pinned in place when the telescope and
wind baffle are precisely aligned.  The clamp controls has been wired into
the control system and given some software work, will operate under
computer control.  <BR><BR>

<LI>The wind baffle servo system was upgraded and the azimuth control loop
made operational.  The industrial PC was replaced with an Allen-Bradley PLC
system. The PLC-based system is connected directly to the interlock system;
operation of both the wind baffle and telescope control systems is now
closely coupled and monitored by the telescope interlocks.  Filters were
installed and motor cabling shielded to eliminate electrical noise
problems.  Performance testing of  the azimuth system demonstrated that the
system tracks the telescope nicely.   Commissioning of the altitude system
will occur once the telescope secondary is installed and the telescope is
balanced in altitude.   <BR><BR>

<LI>Installation of the interlock system continued at a steady pace. The
following systems are now interlocked:  telescope axes motion (azimuth,
altitude, and rotator), telescope drive amplifiers, wind baffle azimuth
motion, telescope enclosure interlocks, and instrument latch operation.
Additionally, the telescope stop buttons are all functional and when
pressed, will disable all telescope and wind baffle drive motors.  <BR><BR>

<LI>The instrument latches were modified by replacing the plated steel hooks
with stainless steel versions.  This replacement eliminated reliability
concerns raised when the plating started flaking off the original hooks.  A
test latch with SST hook successfully completed life-cycle testing and the
six telescope latches all completed 1,000-cycle "burn-in" tests.  The
latches have been re-installed and aligned onto the instrument rotator.
Flow restrictors have also been installed in the latch air lines to soften
the impact velocity of the latch/unlatch motions.  The latches are now
fully functional.  <BR><BR>

<LI>Modifications were made to the telescope drive amplifiers to eliminate
current pulses that were being sent to the drive motors when the amplifiers
were powered on.   The amplifiers were also fine-tuned and matched to their
respective drive motors.  The friction model of the telescope was completed
and PID coefficients developed for all three telescope axes.  Closed-loop
servo tests were performed for the first time on the azimuth and rotator
axes.  Open-loop testing was performed on the altitude axis to verify
system connections in preparation for testing once the secondary and truss
are installed.  The altitude tests were performed with the telescope
pointed at the zenith.    <BR><BR>
