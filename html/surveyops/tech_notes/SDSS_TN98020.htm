<A NAME="OVERVIEW"></A>Overview</H2>
Surface hardness measurements were made on the wind baffle azimuth drive
surface and on the wind baffle azimuth drive rollers.&nbsp; According to
telescope design drawings, the drive surface is made from 1045 hot-rolled
steel and the drive rollers are made from 1040 hot-rolled steel.&nbsp;
There are no surface hardening specifications or references on the drawings
associated with the drive surface or drive rollers.

<P>A portable EQUOTIP hardness tester was used for these measurements.&nbsp;
The measured Brinell hardness of the wind baffle drive surface was 178,
which corresponds to 1040 in a normalized state.&nbsp; The measured Brinell
hardness of the drive roller surface that contacts the drive surface was
211, which indicates that the roller drive surfaces may have been slightly
work-hardened. The Brinell hardness of the drive roller side faces and
flange is 202 and 192, respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Brinell hardness
of 1040 hot-rolled steel in its as-rolled state is 201, it appears that
the roller drive surface is the only part of the roller that may have been
hardened.

<A NAME="HARDNESS MEASURING DEVICE"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Hardness Measuring
Device</FONT></H3>
Hardness measurements on the wind baffle azimuth drive were made on-site
at Apache Point Observatory (APO) using an EQUOTIP hardness tester.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The EQUOTIP system, manufactured by Proceq SA, uses an impact device and
the principle of energy measurement to determine the hardness of a metallic
surface [1].&nbsp;&nbsp; During a hardness measurement, the spring-loaded
impact device is held tight against the test surface.&nbsp; When the spring
of the impact device is released, a spherical tungsten carbide test tip
inside the device is impacted against the test surface.&nbsp; The impact
and rebound velocities of the carbide tip are measured and processed into
a hardness value that is displayed on a digital indicator.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The displayed hardness value is converted into hardness values of other
systems such as Brinell, Vickers, and Rockwell, through the use of supplied
conversion tables. Prior to any conversions, corrections are made to the
raw hardness readings to compensate for measurement variations due to the
orientation of the impact device.

<P>The accuracy of the measurement system is determined by how the measured
values are used.&nbsp;&nbsp; When using the hardness values obtained directly
from the EQUOTIP readout, the average measurement deviation is 0.5% (+/-
4 units throughout the entire measurement range).&nbsp; However, there
is a loss of accuracy when converting the hardness value into static indentation
hardness numbers, such as Brinell or Rockwell.&nbsp; The mean conversion
deviation ranges from +/-3% to +/15%, depending on the measuring range
and the static method used.&nbsp; One reason for the large variation is
that there is no clear physical relationship between the various measurement
methods.&nbsp; A second reason is that the comparison of hardness values
from different scales includes the measuring deviations of each of the
methods.&nbsp; For the measurements described in this report, the conversion
deviation when converting from the raw hardness values into the Brinell
hardness equivalent is +/-7%.

<P>The calibration of the hardness tester was checked and verified before
and after these measurements were made.&nbsp; Calibration was checked against
a standard supplied with the unit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The surface hardness of
the standard was 760 +/- 6.&nbsp; The hardness measured by the tester was
760 for both calibration checks.

<A NAME="DRIVE SURFACE MEASUREMENTS"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Drive Surface Measurements</FONT></H3>
Hardness measurements were made on two surfaces of the wind baffle azimuth
drive assembly.&nbsp; The hardness of the drive surface was measured, as
was the hardness of the surface that will be in contact with the wind baffle
guide rollers.&nbsp; In both cases,&nbsp; hardness measurements were made
every 15 degrees around the drive circumference.&nbsp; At each measurement
location, three readings were taken and averaged to obtain the localized
hardness at that point.&nbsp; The average hardness of the entire surface
was subsequently obtained by averaging all of the readings.

<P>The average Brinell hardness for the drive surface and guide roller
surface is given in the following table.

<P>From Machinery's Handbook, Vol. 24, 1040 hot-rolled steel in the normalized
state has a Brinell hardness of 170, and in the as-rolled state has a Brinell
hardness of 201 [2]. Within the accuracy of these measurements, it appears
that the metal ring that provides the drive and guide roller surfaces has
been normalized but not hardened.&nbsp; The Machinery's Handbook defines
normalizing as the process in which an iron-base alloy is heated to a temperature
above the transformation range and subsequently cooled in still air at
room temperature.&nbsp; Carbon-steels are normalized to put the material
into a uniform, unstressed condition such that the material will respond
to further heat treatments.&nbsp; Normalizing is also used to transform
steel into a sufficiently soft state for machining.&nbsp; For low-carbon
steels, normalizing alone is sufficient.&nbsp; For medium and higher carbon
steels, the normalizing process is typically preceeded by an annealing
process.&nbsp; This two-part process is often called double-annealing.&nbsp;
As 1040 is a medium-carbon steel, it is possible that the drive surface
material was double-annealed.&nbsp; However, that fact cannot be ascertained
from these measurements.&nbsp; What is clear is that neither the drive
surface nor the guide surface have been hardened.

<A NAME="DRIVE ROLLER MEASUREMENTS"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Drive Roller Measurements</FONT></H3>
&nbsp;Hardness measurements were made on each of the three azimuth drive
rollers.&nbsp; For each roller, measurements were made on the drive surface,
the flange surface, and the front and back faces.&nbsp; For each of these
surfaces, the hardness was measured at three locations.&nbsp; For each
location, a set of three readings was taken and averaged.&nbsp; There was
good agreement in the readings for the three rollers, indicating that all
rollers were manufactured in a similar manner.

<P>The average Brinell hardness for the various roller surfaces is given
in the following table.

<P>The drive rollers are made from 1045 hot-rolled steel.&nbsp; Brinell
hardness numbers were not readily available for 1045, so values for 1040
were used for comparison purposes.&nbsp; The Brinell hardness for 1040
in the as-rolled condition is 201, therefore it appears that the rollers
as a whole have not been heat-treated.&nbsp; It appears that the flange
is the softest part of the roller, and that the drive surface has either
been locally treated or has work-hardened due to contact with the drive
surface.

<A NAME="CONCLUSION"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Conclusion</FONT></H3>
Hardness measurement have been made on the wind baffle azimuth drive surface
and azimuth drive rollers.&nbsp; The results indicate that none of these
surfaces have been hardened to any appreciable degree.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is in agreement with the design drawings for these components, which do
not list any specifications or requirements for surface hardening.
