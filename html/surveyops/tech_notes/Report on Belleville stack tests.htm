      was written previously by Larry Bartoszek about the calculated force from 
      a stack of Belleville washers (disk springs). This report documents the 
      experimental results obtained when these stacks of disk springs were 
      tested in the Instron machine in Jay Hoffman's lab at Fermilab. 
      <P>The point of these calculations and tests was to determine how far the 
      spring stack had to be compressed initially such that when the instrument 
      latches latched on the life test fixture at Fermilab they would exert more 
      than enough load equivalent to supporting the weight of the SDSS camera 
      against various accelerations. The design goal was to have at least 700 
      lbf in the stack at the full deflection of the instrument latches. 
      Calculation showed that an initial compression of .158" with the latch in 
      the latched position produced a force of 800 lbs. The springs that were 
      tested were the same size and manufacturer as used in the test fixture at 
      ICB during the life testing of the latches at Fermilab. The actual springs 
      used on the camera were a different size and were modified at Princeton. 
      Appendix 1 gives the data for these other springs tested in the Instron. 
      Princeton used measurements made by Jim Gunn and Mike Carr at the 
      telescope to set the preload for the actual camera. 
      <P>Testing showed that the number to achieve the 800 lbs was closer to 
      .150" of pre-compression, but some aspects of experimental error would 
      lead one to conclude that the number could be slightly higher

      <P><FONT size=4>Discussion of Data:</FONT> 
      <P>Many experiments were run on several sets of springs. Some tests were 
      run lubricated, some unlubricated. The following graph is a summary of 
      many runs with springs unlubricated. The graph shows the force measured on 
      the test machine versus travel of the machine head. One can see that the 
      very first test, series A, and one other were anomalous, with the rest of 
      the data falling within a small band. 
      <P>The chart also shows that the data looks relatively flat at the 
      beginning of the test as the backlash in the system comes out. For this 
      reason, the data was corrected by subtracting out the flat part of the 
      curve at the beginning to create a set of "delta" curves. The delta curves 
      were used to predict the force of the springs as a function of crush.

      <P>The springs were then lubricated and subjected to the same tests over 
      again. The raw data is presented in the following graph. Notice that the 
      first run after the test setup was taken apart, lubricated, and 
      reassembled, showed another anomalous curve when compared to the remaining 
      curves. It is hypothesized that there was some break-in of a stack at 
      initial assembly, but how this is correlated with behaviour at the real 
      telescope is not known.

      <P><FONT size=4>Conclusion:</FONT> 
      <P>Many important things were discovered during the latch and spring 
      testing. Perhaps the most important thing learned was the influence of the 
      hardness of the bolt that the belleville washers were riding on. Many 
      latch tests were confounded by the fact that these springs would dig 
      grooves into any bolt that was less hard than a grade 8 bolt. Once a 
      groove was worn into the bolt, the springs would catch in the groove and 
      not unlatch fully. Grade 8 bolts in the test fixture solved this problem. 
      <P>One thing to note about the delta curves is that at zero deflection, 
      the force is not zero, but about 25 lbs. This is an example of some of the 
      experimental error encountered in the testing, but which is mirrored in 
      the setup of the latch test fixture. It was hard to get zero initial load 
      on the Instron, and hard to know exactly when the stack is at zero 
      compression during the tightening of the bolt in the test fixture. It was 
      felt that it was better to have slightly higher load, than slightly less 
      than desired load. On the Instron, there was always about 10 pounds of 
      preload on the stack when the load was zeroed out prior to making the 
      compression test. On the test fixture, the bolt was always a little snug 
      producing slight preload before the real tightening happened. 
      <P>Another point to note about the delta curves is that lubrication made 
      slight difference to the scatter in the data, but the basic curves are not 
      that different for lubricated and unlubricated springs. The test fixture 
      was always assembled with lubricated springs. The graph of Figure 4 was 
      what was used to set the preload in the life test fixture.

      <P>We can see from this that the force/deflection curve for the actual 
      springs is somewhat different from that of the springs used in the test 
      fixture. These springs are stiffer and there is significantly more scatter 
      in the data, especially at the upper end of force. They achieve a preload 
      of 800 lbs at about .120 inches of deflection (unfortunately right where 
      the scatter starts to get pronounced.)
