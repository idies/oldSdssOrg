<h1>Operation of Telescope Brakes<BR>
	Under Windbaffle Manual Mode</h1>

<P>The following changes have been made to the WINDBAFFLE system for MANUAL
control.
<BR>&nbsp;
<OL>
<LI>
The doghouse crash paddles are now active in Manual mode.&nbsp; Hitting
one will disable motion in that azimuth direction but the windbaffle can
still move in the other direction.<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
If the telescope brakes for the axis you are trying to move are on/engaged,
the windscreen will not move.&nbsp; (i.e., if the Azimuth telescope brakes
are on, the wind screen will not move in azimuth.&nbsp; Same for Altitude.)<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
If the Altitude Servo amplifier goes into a fault condition (such as over
current) the Altitude Windscreen brake will be applied.</LI>
</OL>


<P>On one of my next trips I will try to get an indicator hooked up on
the manual control box for when the brakes are on but I did not have all
the needed parts on this trip.&nbsp; If you have questions I can be reached
at Fermilab at 630-840-3106.
