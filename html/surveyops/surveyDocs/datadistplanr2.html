&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Background</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The NSF Astronomy Division
recognized the value that the SDSS data would have to the astronomy community
when it began its support of the construction and commissioning of the
SDSS in 1994. The Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC), which manages
the SDSS, was required to provide the NSF with an acceptable plan for the
distribution of the data to the astronomy community. The SDSS management
prepared a public data distribution plan and submitted it to the Program
Manager for Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation in the late fall
of 1998. The plan was subsequently peer reviewed by six astronomers, under
the Program Manager’s direction, and their comments were incorporated into
the plan. After several iterations between the reviewers and the Program
Manager, the SDSS management produced the plan presented in this document,
which we will refer to as the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan. The ATI Program Manager
approved the plan in April 1999 and it has been the foundation of our schedule
to release the data to the astronomy community. We propose to augment this
schedule with an early release in mid 2001, which will precede the first
scheduled release in January 2003 as specified in the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan.
This document describes the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan, including the schedule
and the data products, and then describes the early data release .

<P>The SDSS data products vary in complexity and size. The full volume
of data is beyond the capability of most users to store or utilize effectively.
Nevertheless, a single user can undertake a significant research project
with just the positions and redshifts of “only” one million galaxies. Some
research projects do not require data from the complete SDSS area and hence
can be accomplished before the observing phase is complete by using data
that are processed and calibrated as the survey progresses. Some require
significantly more information about each object than the simple redshift
catalog provides, such as the measured photometry of objects and corrected
image frames. Some projects may choose to use different calibration procedures
or even different processing algorithms. These latter projects require
the type of computing facilities that only major computing centers possess.
This data distribution plan takes these various possibilities into consideration.

<P>There is also a trade-off between the prompt availability of the data
to users during the survey and the integrity of the calibrations. Recalling
data is like recalling Firestone Tires, it damages the credibility of the
entire Survey. It is in everyone’s best interests to insure that that the
released data are of high quality and have reliable calibrations.

<P>The schedule for the release to the astronomy community, as defined
in the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan, is shown in the milestone-chart in Figure 1.
Each milestone corresponds to a specific date and the release of a well-defined
percentage of the final data sample. The size of the final data sample
is determined by the five-year baseline survey.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Point of No Return</B></DIV>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<DIV dir="ltr">The interplay between the photometric survey and the spectroscopic
survey defines the SDSS observing strategy by imposing two well-defined
“points of no return” on the data processing. The first occurs when a set
of imaging data is determined to be good enough to allow target selection.
The second occurs when the spectroscopic reductions are good enough to
complete a particular “tile” on the sky. The first event is a particularly
hard boundary: once we drill plates with hole positions fixed for individual
targets and obtain their spectra, it would be very costly to discover that
we had made an erroneous selection of objects and be obliged to re-tile,
re-drill, and re-observe. Thus it is essential for the efficiency of the
survey that we have a clearly defined "point of no return" for target selection.
In effect, the scientific requirements related to the homogeneity of the
spectroscopic survey define the timing and other procedures for acceptance
of the photometric data. The schedule for the data distribution is referenced
to these two points of no return.</DIV>

Quantized Data Release</B></DIV>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<DIV dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">In order to provide a statistically
meaningful version of the data archive, we will release the data in yearly
quanta. The complexity of the SDSS data and the need for time consuming,
repeated verifications of the calibrations creates the latency; the time
interval between the time a quantum of data is processed and calibrated
and the time the data quality has been determined to have met survey requirements.
The latency also includes the time it takes to package the data for distribution.
This latency, which is similar to the one adopted by COBE, was expected
to be eighteen months at the time of the first release. We expect that
it could be gradually decreased to one year by the fifth year of the survey.
As noted later, the time to bring the calibration up to survey requirements
has taken longer than we had planned when the NSF approved the plan.</DIV>

The Schedule for the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan</B></DIV>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<DIV dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">Figure 1 shows the milestones
for the original 1999 plan. They determine the date of each data release
and the fraction of the final data sample released. The triangles in Figure
1 define the critical milestones. These are the beginning of the survey,
the dates that define the last observation to be included within each yearly
quantum of data that will be released to the astronomy community, and the
end of survey observations. We show these for the two main data components,
the photometric catalog and the spectroscopic sample. The intermediate
dates were chosen to be July 1, since the survey’s primary focus is the
North Galactic Cap. The planning assumptions that determined the schedule
are: observations of the northern sky are made during the first two quarters
of every year, the third quarter is largely lost to the monsoon season,
and the northern sky can be observed for about one month during the fourth
quarter. The gray line shows the accumulation of imaging data. The black
line shows the accumulation of processed and calibrated imaging data. This
line shows when plates can be drilled thus enabling the spectroscopic survey.
The dashed line shows the accumulation of spectroscopic data. The data
obtained prior to the “points-of-no-return” is quantized by the mid-year
milestones and will be released at the times shown by the tip of the arrows.
The time to process the spectroscopic data is included in the length of
the gray arrow. The date of the first release specified in the 1999 NSF-SDSS
plan will occur in January 2003 and it will follow the July 2001 milestone
by eighteen months. The vertical positions of the arrows define the total
percentage of the final data sample available to the astronomy community
at the time of the data release. The initial latency was intended to provide
extra time to completely revise the calibration procedure if a problem
were to be discovered during the first year of the survey.</DIV>

Complete Redshift Catalog. The objects targeted for spectroscopy include
galaxies, quasars, stars of various properties, and sources from the ROSAT
and FIRST catalogs. The catalog will contain all relevant photometric information,
as defined in the Compact Photometric Catalog, and redshifts for each object.</LI>

<LI>
Compact Photometric Catalog. This product contains most of the scientifically
useful photometric information for all objects, in a particularly compact
form, to facilitate easy distribution. The number of attributes is kept
to a minimum (id, position, magnitudes, colors, size, ellipticity, position
angle, errors, classification, flags), a total of about 400 bytes/object.
It contains only one (the primary) observation for each object even if
there are multiple epoch detections. This data set will be released on
CD-ROM/DVD/ftp.</LI>

<LI>
Survey Description and Status. The description of the survey is a document.
Most of it is already contained on the SDSS Sampler#1 CD-ROM, also available
at <A HREF="http://www.sdss.org/cdrom1/index.htm">http://www.sdss.org/cdrom1/index.htm</A>.
Updates will be available on-line, as well as on CD-ROM. The survey status
will be an ensemble of many individual data products. These include a list
of the stripes/strips observed to date, status of data processing and targeting,
the status of spectroscopic data processing, status of the instruments,
weather logs, instrument logs. Once the reporting system has been developed,
it will be on-line via the SDSS web site. This proposal requests funds
to speed the completion of the website and the status reports and to make
them accessible to the astronomy community.</LI>

<LI>
Full Photometric Catalog. Parameters including positions, magnitudes, radial
profiles and shape parameters for more than 100 million objects in 5 bands
to the detection limit of the survey. The biggest difference between the
compact and full catalogs is that the full catalog contains several different
kinds of magnitudes, radial profiles in logarithmic bins and their errors,
survey coordinates, pixel coordinates, detailed calibration parameters,
and their versions, various instrumental records, a large set of flags
set during processing. All observations of the objects are contained in
this catalog, not just the primaries. Additionally, mask files define in
detail the sections of an image frame that could not be processed and the
various reasons. This catalog and the mask files will be placed on-line
in a searchable database. This proposal requests funds to produce a user-friendly
method of accessing and searching this database.</LI>

<LI>
Atlas Images. Cutouts of the images of detected objects from the full image
frames in 5 colors, 1 billion images in total. These are ready after the
final photometric processing of the data. Due to their size they will be
available on-line and accessible by their locations, organized into fields.
This proposal requests funds to put this data product on-line in a form
that can be used by the astronomy community.</LI>

<LI>
Compressed Sky Map. A 4x4 compressed version of the image frames after
removing objects. This map, along with the atlas images can be used to
approximately reconstruct the original image frames. This proposal requests
funds to develop the software and distribution tools for a compressed sky
map that could be included with the annual data release.</LI>

<LI>
1-D Spectra. These are extracted from the 2-D images, and the blue and
red halves have been merged together. They are created during the spectroscopic
reduction process, and will be will be released on line, in sync with the
redshift catalog, (ftp/www).</LI>

<LI>
Calibrations. This product contains an astrometric (position) and photometric
(flux) calibration coefficients for the full image frames along with miscellaneous
information such as the seeing and sky background. These will be versioned,
so that the actual calibrations used for target selection will still be
available even after additional work produces better calibrations. This
proposal requests funds to put this data product on-line in a form that
can be used by the astronomy community.</LI>

<LI>
Corrected Imaging Frames. Until recently we did not envisaged distributing
the flat-fielded, corrected imaging frames, which were used for object
detection, widely, even to the SDSS collaboration. They are currently stored
at Fermilab, in an Enstore tape robot with a capacity of 50 TB. The astronomy
community could access the tape robot once we have developed the software
to enable the type of access that astronomers want. The recent sharp drop
in the price/GB for hard disks may enable us to keep this data product
on disk, thereby making it available on line. This proposal requests funds
for the development of the code that will put make this data product accessible
from the Internet by the astronomy community.</LI>
</OL>
<B>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Updated Data Distribution
Schedule</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The survey started three
months later than we had forecast eighteen months ago. We are also finding
that photometric calibrations with a precision of 2% are very difficult
and are taking much more time than we had planned. All of these factors
would be expected to delay the date of the first release of data. While
the observing phase of the survey did not begin until April of this year,
science quality data was obtained during the commissioning period, late
1998 and the first three quarters of 1999. This data sample has yielded
impressive results and we have concluded that the data, once properly processed
and calibrated, is worthy of distributing to the astronomy community. We
expect to apply survey quality calibrations to the commissioning data before
March of 2001. For these reasons, we now plan to release a statistically
significant sample of the commissioning data during the second quarter
of 2001, more than a year ahead of the date of the initial release specified
in the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan. Moreover, we intend to maintain the intermediate
milestones for data release specified in the 1999 NSF-SDSS Plan, albeit
with smaller fractions of the total data sample. We will maintain the date
for the final data release even though observations will continue until
the end of March 2005.

<P>We propose a new data distribution schedule because the long commissioning
period allowed us to accumulate about 400 square degrees of scientifically
valuable data before we resumed observations after repairing the secondary
mirror. The chart in Figure 2 shows the milestones for the new schedule
for releasing the data. Somewhat arbitrarily, we made January 1, 2000 the
effective starting date of the survey in Figure 2, because it simplifies
the graphical presentation. Nevertheless, we plan to use that date as the
starting point for the schedule for the release of data to the astronomy
community. Regular accumulation of raw photometric data began in April
2000, and will end in the summer of 2004, except for some limited opportunities
at the end of 2004. As the observing phase draws to a close, the opportunity
to take imaging data, carry out target selection, drill plates and take
spectra of the associated portion of the sky vanishes. Observations for
the spectroscopy are now expected to begin in the last month of 2000 and
are scheduled to continue to the end of March 2005. In order to meet the
final milestone for the release of the complete sample we will have to
decrease the latency to nine months.

&nbsp;<B>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of the Early Data Release</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">The early data release will
contain nearly 400 square degrees of area on the equator, in both the Northern
and Southern skies. There will also be a small selected area of about 5
square degrees in the Northern Galactic Cap, which we observed in Spring
2000, to support the First Look Survey (FLS) of the SIRTF program. It will
also contain the early spectra that were obtained from the same areas of
the sky. We propose to use two processes to make the data available to
the astronomy community: open access and controlled access In the former
case we will put all of the products, except the Atlas Images, the Science
Data Base (SX), and the Corrected Frames, on the SDSS website. The latter
(controlled access) will contain SX and the Atlas Images, as shown on Figure
3. These are exactly the same services as the ones provided for the SDSS
Collaboration. We feel that the step from supporting the approximately
200 users in the Collaboration to supporting the whole astronomy community
of several thousand is a rather major one, thus we need to proceed carefully
– many of the Fermilab resources are shared with the entire experimental
program at Fermilab.
<BR><B>Open Access</B> will consist of a web-based interface, containing
a database of gif images of the data, with a clickable access to the catalog
information, and a simple search engine to the full photometric catalog.
This will serve as a finding chart (hereafter: chart). At the same time
we will also provide on-line ftp access to the Compact Photometric Catalog
and Calibration information, and to Status Information via the SDSS web
site. These services will be built in collaboration with Jim Gray (Microsoft),
and the necessary hardware will be provided by a grant from Microsoft Research.
The ftp site will also contain the corrected frames for all the internal
files for the 5 square degree FLS area of the sky, with the documentation
required to use the system.
<BR><B>Controlled Access</B> will provide the same data products as will
be found on the web-based interface. In addition, it will provide access
to the high-performance search engine (SDSS Science Archive – SX) built
for the survey. This will enable much larger and more sophisticated queries.
We propose to create an atlas image server that will be accessible to the
astronomy community. It will not only supply the individual atlas images,
but it will be able to reconstruct a corrected frame in FITS format from
the atlas images.
<BR>Each user will be requested to apply for an account to use the Fermilab
Computing Resources, just as all members of the Collaboration have done.
If we find that the resources are easily managed within the available personnel
and funds, we will make SX accessible through our website. The funds to
implement the SX and create the Atlas Image Server (not yet implemented)
for the astronomy community were requested in the August 2000 proposal
to the NSF.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
<DIV dir="ltr">Figure 3 shows the services the SDSS public data distribution

the FTP Server and the WWW server. The Controlled Access side will provide
access to the Science Archive (SX) and later to the Atlas Image Server.
As we understand the usage patterns better, we may consider moving the
Atlas Image service to the Open Access side. The facilities for these early
services should be considered as a beta test of our ultimate Data Distribution
System. These will be continued until the final Data Distribution System
is in place.</DIV>
