<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Introduction</FONT></B>

<P>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey utilizes a system of very complex instruments,
support systems, and software to achieve its scientific and operational
goals.&nbsp; Participants from a large number of institutions are involved
with construction, commissioning, and survey operation. Effective integration
of these systems requires a formal method of decision making for change
control. This process began by putting existing requirements and specifications
documents under change control. As the project progresses and systems and
equipment move from construction into operation, instruments, hardware
support systems, and project software will all be put under configuration
control.

<P>A Change Control Board (CCB) consisting of representatives of the scientific
and technical leadership of the project has been established to oversee
the change control process. Change requests should be submitted to the
Project Manager, who will initiate a meeting of the CCB to consider the
request. Decisions of the CCB will be recorded and approved changes will
be made. All controlled documents will be posted in HTML on the web.&nbsp;
A list of instruments, support systems, and software under configuration
control will also be posted on the web.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Configuration Documentation</FONT></B>

<P>Documents under formal change control include technical requirements
and specifications and will be expanded over time to include other appropriate
documents.&nbsp; At the present time, the following three documents are
under formal change control:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1)
  <a href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/edoc/requirements/scireq/scireq.html">Scientific
Requirements and Scientific Commissioning</a>

<P>2) <A HREF="/surveyops/docs/SDSSRequirements.html">Requirements
and Specifications for the 2.5-Meter Telescope</A>

<P>3) <a href="http://www-sdss.fnal.gov:8000/edoc/protected/combined.req.html">Data
Processing Requirements for SDSS Off-line Software</a></BLOCKQUOTE>
These controlled documents may only be modified by action of the CCB. The
controlled documents will be kept in the existing SDSS CVS repository with
the current version located on the web in HTML.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Change Request</FONT></B>

<P>Action of the CCB is initiated by a Change Request (via email) to the
<A HREF="mailto:boroski@fnal.gov">Project Manager</A>. The Change Request
will contain arguments for revising a controlled document or some part
of a system or component configuration. The Change Request will be circulated
to the CCB by the Project Manager for review and consideration.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Change Control Board Meetings</FONT></B>

<P>The Project Manager will call a telephone meeting of the CCB to consider
a change request and when appropriate, to hear the arguments for change
by the requester. Decisions of the CCB will be made by consensus and will
be recorded and circulated by the Project Manager.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Change Order</FONT></B>

<P>If the decision is made to modify a controlled document or a system
configuration, the Project Manager will work with the appropriate individuals
to initiate the revision process.&nbsp; If a controlled document is being
revised, the modified document will be updated in CVS and posted to the
web.&nbsp; If a system is being modified, the Project Manager and Technical
Director will work with the appropriate individuals to establish appropriate
acceptance tests to verify that the change was made correctly, satisfies
the new requirement, and that the change had no adverse or unanticipated
impact on the modified system or any systems which interface with the modified
system..
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>The Change Control Board</FONT></B>

<P>The Project Scientist will chair the CCB.&nbsp; In the absence of the Project
Scientist, the Project Manager will chair the CCB.&nbsp; The Project
Manager prepares and distributes the agenda for CCB meetings and is responsible
for distributing the decisions of the CCB to the appropriate individuals
for follow-up action..

<P>The CCB consists of the following members:
<BLOCKQUOTE> Project Scientist - Jim Gunn
<BR>Project Manager - Bill Boroski
<BR>APO Site Operations Manager - Bruce Gillespie
<BR>Head of Survey Coordination - Steve Kent
<BR>Head of Data Processing and Distribution - Chris Stoughton
<BR>Deputy Project Scientist - Michael Strauss</BLOCKQUOTE>
Other SDSS participants will be asked to participate in CCB meetings based
upon the issues on the agenda.
