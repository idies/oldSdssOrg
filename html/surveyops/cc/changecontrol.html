<h2>
SDSS Change Control</h2>

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey utilizes a system of very complex instruments,
support systems, and software to achieve its scientific and operational goals.&nbsp;
Participants from a large number of institutions were involved with construction
and commissioning activities, and are now involved in survey operations.
Effective integration and operating of these systems requires a formal method of
decision making for change control. 
<p>A Change Control Board (CCB) consisting of representatives of the scientific
and technical leadership of the project has been established to oversee the
change control process. Change requests are submitted to the Project Manager,
who will initiate a meeting of the CCB to consider the request. Decisions of the
CCB will be recorded and approved changes will be made. All controlled documents
will be posted in HTML on the web.&nbsp; Details of the change control process,
the CCB, and a record of CCB meetings can be found at the following links:</p>
