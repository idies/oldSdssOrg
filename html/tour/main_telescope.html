<h2>The survey telescope</h2>

The 2.5-meter Sloan telescope is unusual because it has a remarkably
wide-angle view, and because it was made specifically to create a map of
the sky.  The telescope's <a

target="new">camera</a> uses electronic sensors that 
turn light into a stream of digitized data.  The telescope also uses two

target="new">spectrographs</a>, 
instruments that probe the composition and distance of
celestial objects.  Here you can see the fully assembled telescope
pointing toward zenith.  The boxy metal structure is the outer wind
baffle, mounted separately from the rest of the telescope.  It helps
prevent the wind from shaking the telescope.

This is what the telescope looked like before the secondary mirror
assembly was attached.  The primary mirror will sit inside that
cylindrical "drum."  It's easy to point out from the photo that this is
an altitude-azimuth mounted telescope.  That means that the telescope
pivots around the vertical axis and also rotates in the direction from
the horizon to the zenith.  This is a newer type of telescope mounting,
and increasingly popular because it's less bulky than the traditional
right ascension/declination mounting.  It's also more challenging to
control, because the telescope motion doesn't correspond to the apparent
nightly motion of stars in the sky.

In this photo, the Sloan telescope's skeleton is complete, but it still
needs some "fleshing out."  The secondary mirror hasn't been installed
yet; neither have the internal light baffles or the external wind
baffle.
