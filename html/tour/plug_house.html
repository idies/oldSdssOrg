<a name="plugplate">Astronomers will select 600 distant objects at a time 
for spectral
analysis.  In the support building, shown above, astronomers will plug
drilled aluminum discs with optical fiber cables to feed light from the
telescope to <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/dr4/en/sdss/instruments/instruments.asp#spectrographs" 
target="new">spectrographs</a>.  When attached to the telescope, each 
cable will be located at the celestial position of a selected object.</a>

The aluminum plug plate from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (shown at
left) illustrates what an SDSS plate will look like after it has been
drilled with holes. For each hole, there's a corresponding object in
the sky waiting to have its spectrum observed.

On the right is a view of a plug plate that's been drilled, fitted with
optical fibers, and mounted on the spectograph assembly. This entire
package will be flipped upside down and mounted to the underside of the
2.5-meter telescope at its focal plane.
