<h2>The Science of the SDSS</h2>

<p><img src="../photos/bubble.gif" alt="Soap bubbles" width="100"

The universe today is filled with sheets of galaxies curving through
mostly empty space.  Like soap bubbles in a sink, they form voids and
come together along lines that form dense filaments.  Our best model for
how the universe began, the Big Bang, gives us a picture of a universe
filled with a hot, uniform soup of fundamental particles.  Somehow,
between the time when the universe began and today, gravity has pulled
together the matter into regions of high density, leaving behind empty
voids.  What triggered this change from uniformity to structure?
Understanding the origin of the structure that we see in the universe
today is a crucial part of reconstructing our cosmic history.</p>

<p>The quest is made more difficult because the luminous stars and
galaxies that we see are only a small part of the total material in the
universe.  The nature, amount and distribution of the "dark matter" are
among the most important questions in astrophysics.  How has the gravity
from dark matter influenced the visible structures?  Or, put another
way, by careful mapping of the positions and motions of galaxies, we can
reconstruct the distribution of the gravitating mass, and from that find
clues about dark matter.</p>

<h3>A Map of the Universe</h3>

<p>One of the difficulties in studying the entire universe is the
problem of getting enough information to assemble a global picture.
Astronomers designed the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to address this
problem in a direct and ambitious way, by gathering a body of data large
and accurate enough to be useful in addressing a broad range of
astronomical questions.</p>

<p>The Sky Survey will obtain high-resolution pictures of one quarter of
the entire sky in five different colors.  From these pictures, advanced
image processing software will measure the shape, brightness, and color
of hundreds of millions of astronomical objects including stars,
galaxies, quasars (compact yet ultraluminous objects thought to be
powered by material falling into giant black holes), and an array of
other celestial exotica.  Selected galaxies and quasars will be observed
using an instrument called a spectrograph to determine accurate
distances to a million galaxies and 100,000 quasars, and to provide a
wealth of information about the individual objects.  These data will
give the astronomical community one of the things it most needs: a
comprehensive catalog of the constituents of a representative part of
the universe.</p>

<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey will map the three-dimensional
distribution of matter through a volume about a hundred times bigger
than the volume explored so far.  This map will reveal how big the
largest structures in our universe are, and what they look like.  It
will help us understand the mechanisms that converted a uniform
"primordial soup" into a frothy network of galaxies.</p>

<h3>An Intergalactic Census</h3>

<p>The U.S. Census Bureau collects statistical information about how
many people live in the U.S., where they live, their race, their family
income, and other characteristics.  The Census becomes a primary source
of information for people trying to understand the nation.  In a sort of
celestial census, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey will gather information
about how many galaxies and quasars there are in the universe, how they
are distributed, their individual properties, and how bright they are.
Astronomers will use this information to study questions such as why
flat spiral galaxies are found in less dense regions of the universe
than football-shaped elliptical galaxies, or how the enigmatic quasars
have changed during the history of the universe.</p>

<p>The Sky Survey will also collect information about the Milky Way
galaxy and even about our own solar system.  The wide net cast by the
Sky Survey telescope will sweep up as many stars as galaxies, and as
many asteroids in our solar system as quasars in the universe.
Knowledge of these objects will help us learn how stars are distributed
in our galaxy, and where asteroids fit into the history of our solar
system.</p>

<h3>Needles in a Haystack, Lighthouses in the Fog</h3>

<p>Rare objects, almost by definition, are scientifically interesting.
By sifting through the several hundred million objects recorded by the
Sky Survey, scientists will be able to construct entire catalogs of the
most distant quasars, the rarest stars, and the most unusual galaxies.
The most unusual objects in the catalog will be about a hundred times
rarer than the rarest objects now known.  For example, stars with a
chemical composition very low in metals like iron are the oldest in the
Milky Way.  They can therefore tell us about the formation of our
galaxy.  However, such stars are also extremely rare, and only a
wide-field deep sky survey can find enough of them to form a coherent
picture.</p>

<p>Because they are so far away, quasars can serve as probes for
intergalactic matter throughout the visible universe.  In particular,
astronomers can identify and study galaxies by the way they block
certain wavelengths of light emitted by a quasar.  Using the light from
quasars, the Sky Survey will detect tens of thousands of galaxies in the
initial stages of formation.  These galaxies are typically too faint and
too diffuse to be detected in their own light by even the largest of
telescopes.  Quasar probes will also allow scientists to study the
evolution of the chemistry of the universe throughout its history.</p>

<h3>The Telescope as a Time Machine</h3>

<p>Peering into the universe with a telescope allows us to look not only
out into space, but also back in time.  Imagine intelligent beings in a
planetary system around a star 30 light years away.  Suppose these
beings pick up a stray television transmission from Earth.  They would
see events now 30 years past on earth, and might, for instance, view a
newscast covering the construction of the foundation of the Sears Tower.
While today we see the tower as a completed work, they might see workmen
pouring the tower's foundation.  We think of light as traveling
extremely fast, but the universe is a very big place.  In fact,
astronomers routinely look at quasars that are so far away that it takes
billions of years for the light they produce to reach us.  When we look
at galaxies or quasars that are billions of light-years away, we are
seeing them as they were billions of years ago.</p>

<p>By looking at galaxies and quasars at different distances,
astronomers can see how their properties change with time.  The Sky
Survey will measure the "local" distribution of galaxies, allowing
comparison with more distant samples now being obtained by the new
generation of instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck
Telescope.  Because quasars are very bright, the Sky Survey will allow
astronomers to study their evolution through more than 90 percent of the
history of the universe.</p>

<h3>Measuring Distance and Time: Red Shift</h3>

<p><img src="../photos/bread.jpg" alt="Raisin bread" width="159"

Think of the universe as a loaf of raisin bread rising in an oven.
The universe is expanding in the same way as the rising loaf.  Now pick
any raisin, and imagine it's our own Milky Way galaxy.  No matter how
you look at it, as the bread rises, all the other raisins are moving
away from our raisin.  The farther away another raisin is from our
raisin, the faster it is moving away.  In the same way, all the other
galaxies are moving away from ours as the universe expands.  And because
the universe is uniformly expanding, the farther a galaxy is from Earth,
the faster it is receding from us.</p>

<p>The light coming to us from these distant objects is shifted toward
the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum, in much the same way the
sound of a train whistle changes as a train leaves or approaches a
station, compared to the way the pitch is perceived when the train is in
the station.  The faster a distant object is moving, the more it is
red-shifted.  Astronomers measure the amount of red shift in the spectrum
of a galaxy to figure out how far away it is from us.</p>

<p>By measuring the red shift of a million galaxies, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey will provide a three-dimensional picture of our local
neighborhood of the universe.</p>
