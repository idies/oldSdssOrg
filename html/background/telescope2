<h2>The telescope</h2>

<p>The telescope combines a sophisticated optical system, an advanced
electronic camera for two-dimensional images, and a spectrograph for
locating objects in three dimensions.  A computer-controlled system
moves the telescope up ad down (Bearing A) and from side to side
(Bearing B), controlling speed and direction for each long sweep of the
sky. Bearing C rotates to keep the instruments aligned on the sky.</p>
