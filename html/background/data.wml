<h2>Processing the SDSS Data</h2>

<p>On a clear, dark night, light that has traveled through space for a
billion years touches a mountaintop in southern New Mexico.  At that
moment, photons that left their source when algae were the only life on
earth enter the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's 2.5-meter telescope and yield
to the telescope's sophisticated instrumentation the cargo of
information they have carried across the universe.  They cease to exist
as photons, but the data within them live on as digital images recorded
on magnetic tape, each image composed of myriad pixels (or picture
elements), and each pixel capturing the brightness from each tiny point
in the sky.</p>

<p>But the sky is not made of pixels; stars and galaxies are real
objects.  The task of data management for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
is to take the digitized data, the pixels electronically encoded on the
mountaintop in New Mexico, and turn them into real information about
real things.  Astronomers process the digitized data to produce
information that they can use to identify and measure the properties of
stars and galaxies.  They must be able to find, distinguish, and measure
the brightness of celestial objects from the imaging pixel data, and
then collect these stars and galaxies and quasars into a catalog.</p>

<p>Computing experts describe the project as something like creating the
Manhattan phone book, for the heavens.  Each star is like a person in
the phone book, with a name and address.  There is even a Yellow Pages
in the celestial directory, a section containing a smaller number of
entries for which the Survey will provide still more information in the
form of spectra.  For these objects, digitized data yield information
about their velocity as they move away from the Earth, from which we can
calculate how far away they are.</p>

<p>Scientists must initially process the data very quickly (within about
a week) because Sky Survey astronomers need the information in order to
configure their telescope's instrumentation for best use of the
instrument during the next dark phase of the moon.  If too much time
goes by, the target objects will set as the season passes.</p>

<p>Scientists at <a href="../members/fermi.html">Fermilab</a> are
leading the effort to develop what the Sky Survey calls data-processing
pipelines.  A pipeline is a computer program that processes the
digitized data in order to extract from it certain types of information.
The term pipeline connotes the automated nature of the data processing;
the data "flow" through the pipelines with little human intervention.
The astrometric pipeline, built by computer scientists at the <a
href="../members/usno.html">U.S. Naval Observatory</a>, for example,
determines the precise absolute two-dimensional position of stars and
galaxies in the sky.  In this case, digitized data from photons reaching
the 2.5-meter telescope go in one end of the astrometric pipeline, and
star positions come out the other. In between, along the length of the
pipeline, is the software that changes pixels into real information.</p>

<p>The data pipelines are a collaborative effort.  <a
href="../members/princeton.html">Princeton University</a> scientists
built the photometric pipeline, and <a href="../members/uchicago.html">
University of Chicago</a> experts created the spectroscopic pipeline.
Fermilab's contributions include the monitor-telescope pipeline and the
pipeline for selection of candidates for spectroscopy.  Fermilab also
coordinates the smooth operation of all the pipelines.</p>

<p>Information processing for the Sky Survey begins with data
acquisition.  Photons from the stars hit the telescope's detectors, and
CCDs collect them.  Charge "buckets" are then converted to digitized
signals and written to tape on the mountain.  The data travel from <a
href="../members/apo.html">Apache Point</a> to Fermilab via express
courier.  The tapes go to Fermilab's Feynman Computing Center and thence
into the various pipelines: spectrographic data into the spectrographic
pipeline; monitor data into the monitor pipeline; and imaging data into
the astrometric, photometric, target selection and two other pipelines.
Out of the pipelines comes information about the stars, galaxies and
quasars, for inclusion in the Operations Database, written at Fermilab
and at the Naval Observatory, which collates the information to keep the
Sky Survey running.</p>

<p>Eventually, experimenters will pass the information in the Operations
Database "over the firewall" to the science data base developed by
scientists at <a href="../members/jhu.html">Johns Hopkins
University</a>.  It will operate as a query engine to make the data
readily usable by scientists on the project.</p>

<p>The form in which we realize the sky is necessarily governed by the
available technology.  Surveys conducted 50 years ago stored imaging data
in the form of photographic plates, and catalogs in the form of printed
books.  Today, we store images in digitized form on magnetic tape or
hard disks, and catalogs are digital databases. But whatever the
age and with whatever technology, we still look up, and the sky is full
of stars.</p>
