<font size="+2"><a href="../members/apo.html">Apache Point
Observatory</a>, </font>in Sunspot, New Mexico, is owned and operated by
the Astrophysical Research Consortium, a not-for-profit consortium of
seven research institutions whose mission is to develop and operate
astronomical research facilities for scientists affiliated with the
member institutions and their collaborators. Principal projects at the
site are a 3.5-meter telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

<p>The multi-purpose 3.5-meter telescope provides astronomers data to
develop and refine theories on how planets, stars, nebulae and other
celestial objects form and evolve. The telescope boasts several
innovative features including remote control, rapid instrument change
capability, light-weight construction, and unique sky-monitoring
capabilities. The ability to operate remotely allows several astronomers
to share the telescope on a given night, using whichever arrays of the
telescope's different instruments best suit their needs.

<p>Apache Point also provides support for <a
href="http://charon.nmsu.edu">New Mexico State University</a>'s
1.0-meter telescope, operated for research and graduate
instruction. Using design features from the 3.5-meter telescope, the
smaller telescope is computer controlled, either from the site or from
NMSU's campus.

<p>The site's support facilities include an operations building housing
work areas for telescopes and instruments, as well as computer control
rooms for each telescope. A modest machine shop handles small-scale
onsite projects, and a suite of dormitory rooms houses overnight
visitors.

<p>Apache Point Observatory provides premier facilities and superior
climatic conditions for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.  The site is
surrounded by scenic Lincoln National Forest in the Sacramento Mountains
of south-central New Mexico. At 9200 feet, the atmosphere contains
little water vapor and few contaminants to degrade celestial
images. APO's night sky is among the darkest in the United States,
because of the site's clean air and distance from large cities. Such
conditions contribute to optimum seeing for astronomers.

<p>Conducting the Sky Survey required the construction of two telescopes
and a survey support building, as well as modification of the existing
operations buildings.  With major support from the seven collaborating
ARC institutions, APO staff and others, engineering and scientific
collaborations have undertaken the myriad construction, installation,
and commissioning tasks for the telescopes, supporting instruments and
infrastructure.

<p>Observatory staff operate and maintain the telescopes, instruments
and infrastructure for the Sky Survey, including preparation of the plug
plates for spectroscopic surveys.

<p>Apache Point Observatory is operated for ARC by New Mexico State
University.
