<p>On a clear, dark night, light that has traveled through space for
billions of years touches a mountaintop in southern New Mexico.  At that
moment, photons that left their source when algae were the only life on
earth enter the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's sophisticated 2.5-meter
telescope and yield the cargo of information they have carried across the
universe.  While they cease to exist as photons, the data within them live
on as digital images recorded on magnetic tape, each image composed of
myriad pixels (or picture elements), and each pixel capturing the
brightness from each tiny point in the sky.</p>

<p>But the sky is not made of pixels. Stars and galaxies are real objects. 
The task of data management for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is to
take those electronically encoded pixels and turn them into real
information about real things.  Astronomers process this digitized data to
produce information that they can use to identify and measure the
properties of stars and galaxies.  They must be able to find, distinguish
and measure the brightness of celestial objects from the data, then
collect these stars, galaxies and quasars into a catalog.</p>

<p>Computing experts liken the project to creating the Manhattan phone
book, only for the heavens.  Each star is like a person in the phone book,
with an individual name and address.  There is even a celestial Yellow
Pages, a section of directory containing a smaller number of entries for
which SDSS provides still more information in the form of
spectra.  For these objects, digitized data yield additional information
about their velocity as they move away from the Earth, information from
which to calculate how far away they are.</p>

<p>Information processing for SDSS begins with data acquisition. 
Photons from the stars hit the SDSS telescope's detectors and CCDs (very
sensitive digital cameras) collect them.  Charge "buckets" are then
converted to digitized signals and written to tape on the mountain. The
data travel from <a href="../members/apo.html">Apache Point</a> to
Fermilab via express courier. The tapes are delivered to Fermilab's Feynman 
Computing Center where the information on them is funneled into the various 
data processing pipelines:
spectrographic data into the spectrographic pipeline; monitor data into
the monitor pipeline; and imaging data into the astrometric, photometric,
target selection and two other pipelines. Data "flow" into these
software pipelines and information about the stars, galaxies and quasars
flow out. That information is then put into the Operations Database,
written at Fermilab and at the Naval Observatory, which collates the
information to keep SDSS running.</p>

<p>The data processing pipelines are a collaborative effort led by <a 
href="../members/fermi.html">Fermilab</a>. <a
href="../members/princeton.html">Princeton University</a> scientists built
the photometric pipeline and <a href="../members/uchicago.html">
University of Chicago</a> experts created the spectroscopic pipeline.
Fermilab's contributions include the monitor-telescope pipeline and the
pipeline for selection of candidates for spectroscopy.  Fermilab also
coordinates the smooth operation of all the pipelines.</p>

<p>Eventually, experimenters will pass the information in the Operations
Database "over the firewall" to the science database developed by
scientists at <a href="../members/jhu.html">Johns Hopkins University</a>. 
<a href="http://cas.sdss.org/dr5/en/">This database</a> operates as a query 
engine making the data readily usable by scientists on the project.</p>

<p>After imaging data is taken, objects of interest to SDSS scientists are
tagged for follow-up. Coordinates for those objects are used to create <a
href="/tour/plug_house.html#plugplate">"plug-plates"</a>. These plug
plates are used to take simultaneous spectra of 600 targets all at once. 
Because astronomical objects set earlier each night, data processing
operates quickly (within about a week) so that follow-up spectra can be
taken before the object has set for the year.</p>

<p>Technology has governed the way we study the sky. Surveys conducted 50
years ago stored imaging data in the form of photographic plates, and
catalogs in the form of printed books.  Today, we store images in
digitized form on magnetic tape or hard disks, and catalogs are digital
databases. But whatever the age and with whatever technology, we still
look up, and the sky is full of stars.</p>
