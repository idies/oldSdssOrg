3C273 was the first discovered, brightest, and probably most studied
quasar. Quasars are the active nuclei of galaxies, bright enough to be
seen even when the host galaxy is too faint. Because of this, they
generally look like stars in images. Like other active galactic
nuclei such as that of M87, quasars often have associated jets; the
jet of 3C273 can be seen clearly in this image.
