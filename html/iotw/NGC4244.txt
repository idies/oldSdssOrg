NGC 4244 is a nearby, edge-on disk galaxy. It is close enough that
individual stars can be detected and measured, which allows
astronomers to use stellar properties to estimate the distance. There
appears to be little or no central bulge, and only a few star forming
regions are visible; there is little active star formation.
