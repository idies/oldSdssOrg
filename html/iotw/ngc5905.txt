Shown are two spiral galaxies in Draco, NGC 5905 (right) and NGC 5908.  These two galaxies gracefully display the vast range of observational characteristics such as inclination, dust content, and stellar populations.  NGC 5905 displays its wide spiral arms, consisting of young, blue stars and hydrogen gas.  The bar in the center is composed mostly of older, yellow stars.  NGC 5908 is seen edge-on, with a large dust lane absorbing visible light.  Again, younger, bluer stars are seen near the outskirts of the galaxy.  

This wide-field image also displays a large number of stars in our own Milky Way(another spiral galaxy), mostly populated by cool, red stars.
