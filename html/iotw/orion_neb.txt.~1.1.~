Shown above is one of the most imaged parts of the night sky, the Orion Nebula.  Located just below "Orion's Belt"  this star-forming region is dominated by four young, massive O stars (known as the Trapezium, not pictured here).  The wispy blue, green gas seen above is composed mostly of hydrogen, the main element used in forming stars.  The Orion Nebula is an astrophysical laboratory, providing an up-close view of the birth of stars.
