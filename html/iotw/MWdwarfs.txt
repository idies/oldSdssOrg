Meet the new neighbors! Two new dwarf galaxies, one in the constellation
Bootes (left) and one in Canes Venatici (right), were recently discovered
in the SDSS-II data. Though they are right in our cosmic backyard --
190,000 and 640,000 lights years away respectively -- the newly discovered
dwarf galaxies are extremely dim, making them hard to spot.  These two put
the total number of companion galaxies to our Milky Way at ten. But with
the SDSS-II SEGUE project probing the Milky Way's structure in
unprecedented detail more dwarfs are sure to turn up. (Image credit:
