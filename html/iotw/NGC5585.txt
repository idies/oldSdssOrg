NGC 5585 is a "flocculent" galaxy in Ursa Major. Galaxies of this type have 
the disk shape of a spiral but instead of well-defined arms, their brightest 
stars are in a fluffier, more stochastic arrangement. NGC 5585's 
appearance may be the result of interactions with other galaxies in the 
M101 group.
