NGC 1055 is an edge-on spiral galaxy in the constellation Cetus.  With its nearby neighbor, M77 
(also in Cetus), NGC 1055 forms a binary galaxy pair that is thought to be interacting gravitationally,
much like our own Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy.  This galaxy is also thought to be undergoing
rapid star formation.
