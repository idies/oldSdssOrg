NGC 2549 is an example of a lenticular galaxy, seen nearly
edge-on. Lenticular galaxies are disk galaxies without visible spiral
structure, and get their name because they often resemble a lens seen
edge-on. In the Hubble classification, they are regarded as an
intermediate between spiral and elliptical galaxies. Three structural
components frequently seen in galaxies are pronounced in this image: a
bright central disk, a bright central envelope, and a faint extended
envelope. Several smaller galaxies can be seen in this image; such
companion galaxies are common around large galaxies.
