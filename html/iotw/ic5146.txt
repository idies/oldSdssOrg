The green, gaseous nebula shown here is the H II region, IC 5146, also known as the Cocoon Nebula.  The 'II' in H II indicates that the hydrogen gas that enshrouds these young stars is ionized, which is the result of the hot, young stars that are scattered throughout the nebula.  These stars have formed recently, and are starting to burn away the cooler gas that condensed to form them.  The color scheme used here is the result of the SDSS filter set and data software.  Hence, gas that is usually red in other images appears green here.
