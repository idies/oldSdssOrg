NGC 660 is a polar ring galaxy in the constellation Pisces. The galaxy
itself is seen edge-on from our part of the universe but the faint ring
surrounding NGC 660 is seen at an angle. This ring around the galaxy was
likely the product of a violent collision with another galaxy in the past, 
one which has sparked a burst of star formation at NGC 660's core.
