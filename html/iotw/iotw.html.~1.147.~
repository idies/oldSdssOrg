<p> 
NGC 5701, located in the constellation Virgo, is a classic example of a barred spiral galaxy.  The yellow bulge, composed of older stars, has a distinct bar running vertically in this image.  At larger distances from the center of this galaxy, bluer spiral arms wrap around, which is an indication of recent star formation.  The formation of bars in spiral galaxies is not well understood, and large computer simulations are used to explore how they might come to be.
