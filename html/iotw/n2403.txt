This splendid spiral galaxy is located in the constellation
Camelopardus (the Giraffe).  It is a member of a group of galaxies that also
includes Messier 81 and Messier 82.  Galaxies come in a wide range of sizes;
NGC 2403 is about in the middle of the pack.  It has no central bulge to
speak of, but does exhibit a large number of HII regions (the knots
sprinkled throughout the spiral arms) and several small lanes of dust.
