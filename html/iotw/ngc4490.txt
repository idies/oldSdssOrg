This pair of galaxies, known as the Cocoon Galaxy, form an astrophysical laboratory for studying interacting galaxies.  These two spiral galaxies (NGC 4490 on the bottom) are being pulled towards each other by gravity, distorting their shapes.  The pair has also undergone a recent collision, which touched off a spurt of star formation, as seen in the blue-green bright spots that are seen in both galaxies. The Cocoon Galaxy is located in Canes Venatici, and is easily visible in a six-inch telescope, during the spring.
