Messier 51, nicknamed the Whirlpool Galaxy, is the classic spiral. Its
dusty arms sweep in front of the smaller galaxy to the left, well behind
M51. This Sc-type galaxy shows a heavy amount of star formation sparked by
its interaction with the smaller galaxy. This pair make a good observing
challenge for amateur astronomers with dark skies and a modest telescope.
Look for it just below the tip the Big Dipper's handle, in the nearby
constellation of Canes Venatici.
