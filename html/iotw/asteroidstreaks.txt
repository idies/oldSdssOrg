How does an asteroid appear in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey? This asteroid
moved a significant amount during the five minutes that it took to make
this image causing the red, green and blue streaks pictured here. Since
each patch of sky is imaged in five filters in succesion, a moving object
shows up in different locations in each of the different filters. Only three
of the five filters are used to make this image, giving rise to the three 
colored streaks. 

Asteroids were in the public eye this week as astronomers at the 2006
International Astronomical Union meeting for the first time defined what
is a planet. Though near-Earth asteroids like the one pictured here are
typically very small, other larger bodies in the asteroid belt may soon be
upgraded from asteroid to dwarf planet.
