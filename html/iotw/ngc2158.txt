NGC 2158, an open cluster that neighbors Messier 35, is shown above.  NGC 2158 is fairly old, and most of its younger stars have evolved off the main sequence, and older, yellow stars now compose the majority of this cluster.  It is a few billion years old, and like many open clusters, serves as an important test of stellar evolution models.
