Because blue stars have short lifetimes, the blue color of this galaxy
indicates that most of the light from this galaxy is from recently
formed stars. Spectra of IZw18 show few heavy elements, providing
additional evidence that the stars in this galaxy are young; older
stars would have generated more heavy elements. It has therefore been
heavily studied to improve our understanding of star formation in
primordial conditions.
