Bright young star clusters surrounded by wispy filaments of gas comprise
the most striking features of NGC 4214. This irregular galaxy resides 13
million light years away in the constellation Canes Venatici. Winds from
young stars and supernovae have shaped gas clouds into the bubbles seen
near the bright core and filaments throughout. Clusters of varying age
imply an active star-forming past as well as present in NGC 4214.
