NGC 2420 is one of the few open clusters observed in the original
SDSS survey. Most open clusters reside in the disk of the milky way,
because that is where there is the most material for new star
formation. The coverage of the original SDSS avoided this area,
however, so that data on extragalactic sources could be collected with
minimal obstruction from material in our own galaxy. We have recently
begun data collection for the SDSS-II survey, which will extend the
survey coverage into the milky way.
