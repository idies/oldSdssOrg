The ghostly blue object is Abell 55, a planetary nebula.  A planetary
nebula is a glowing ball of gas powered by a very hot star in the center.
The nebula is thought to form near the end of a star's life when the
surface layers of the stars are ejected into space, leaving behind
the hot central core.  In the distant future, the nebula
will disperse and the remnant stellar core will cool down and become
a white dwarf.  The bright star in the upper left corner of the picture
is probably unrelated.
