Starting at the bottom of the image and going up are NGC 6975, 6976, 6977
and 6978, the compact group of galaxies known as HCG 88. The lower two are
type Sbc galaxies while NGC 6978 (top) is a more tightly wound Sb. NGC
6977 is a barred spiral SBb, just like our own galaxy. These four, which
reside in the constellation Aquarius, show no signs of previous or current
interactions. In the left-most three you can see the rate of star
formation neatly increase as you go up.
