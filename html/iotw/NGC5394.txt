NGC 5394 and NGC 5395 - shall we waltz? Frequent turns around the
cosmic dance floor have given these galaxies many of their most
interesting features. NGC 5395 (the larger of the two main galaxies shown)
boasts dark lanes and knotted spiral arms in the visible wavelengths and a
long tidal tail seen in radio. NGC 5394 has both inner and outer spiral
arms and a burst of star formation near its center. Radio studies of this
pair show that they are headed for another collision millions of years
from now as gravity swings them closer together.
