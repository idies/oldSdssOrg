Messier 76, nicknamed the "Little Dumbbell Nebula" in reference to the
Dumbbell Nebulae (Messier 27), is roughly the same size as its more famous
namesake. It is, however, about five times as far away, and therefore
appears much smaller. Planetary nebulae are so named because some of
them have a disk-like appearance, similar to the appearance of a planet
in a telescope. They are, however, not related to planets at all, but
instead are clouds of gas expelled by a star near the end of its life,
and illuminated by that star.
