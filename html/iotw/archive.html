<h2>Orion Nebula</h2>
<p>
       Shown above is part of one of the most imaged parts of the night sky, the Orion Nebula.  Since the angular size of Orion's Nebula is so large on the sky, only a portion is shown here.  Located just below "Orion's Belt"  this star-forming region is dominated by four young, massive O stars (known as the Trapezium, not pictured here).  The wispy blue, green gas seen above is composed mostly of hydrogen, the main element used in forming stars.  The Orion Nebula is an astrophysical laboratory, providing an up-close view of the birth of stars.

<h2>Messier 34</h2>

       Shown above are the stellar members of the open cluster Messier 34.  Most open clusters are younger than the Sun, and thus their more massive stars are still on the main sequence.  Many of the blue and purple stars in this image are more massive than the Sun.  Their color indicates that these stars are hotter than the Sun and burning through their fuel more rapidly.  This rapid production of energy directly contributes to their short lifetimes.  These stars really do live fast and die young!

While the galaxy is a pretty typical spiral, almost edge-on, with blue spiral arms and some dust features, it is neighbored by a member of our own Milky Way, a red dwarf.  This star is less massive than the Sun, with a spectral type of M0.  M dwarfs are the most common type of star, making up about 75% of all stars in the Milky Way.  Yet, like the star in this image, most are too faint to be seen with the naked eye.  This once made M dwarfs strong candidates for dark matter, but this idea has been discarded.

Planetary nebula is a misnomer, as these complexes of gas have little to do with actual planets.

       While the SDSS camera does a great job at scanning the stars and galaxies of the Cosmos, it runs into problems when it tries to image moving objects, such as the meteor trail shown above.  Meteors are the result of small particles around the size of pebbles entering the Earth's atmosphere and burning up due to the large frictional forces by it.  Meteor showers, such as this summer's Perseids, occur when the Earth's orbit intersects debris left by a comet (in the Perseids case, it is Comet Swift-Tuttle), resulting in a proliferation of meteors.

light from it to appear more red (if it is moving away from us) or blue
(if it is moving toward us) that it would if it were not moving. Most
galaxies are found to be moving away from us due to the expansion of
the universe. This expansion, however, is not the only factor in

<h2>CGCG 180-023</h2>

       CGCG 180-023, also called II Hz 4, is a superb example of a ring
galaxy.  Ring galaxies are believed to form when a compact smaller
galaxy plunges through the center of a larger more diffuse rotating
disk galaxy. The galaxy in transit exerts a brief inward pull on the
stars of the target galaxy, which execute radial harmonic oscillations
in addition to their initial circular motion. A series of ring waves
forms and propagates through the target disk, as numerical simulations
have convincingly demonstrated (e.g., Lynds &amp; Toomre 1976; Theys &amp;
Spiegel 1977). These radially expanding waves are accompanied by a
strong burst of star formation: observed ring galaxies are usually
very blue and possess large HII regions (Theys &amp; Spiegel 1976; Jeske
1986).
