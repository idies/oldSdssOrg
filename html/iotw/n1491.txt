This object is an HII region in the constellation Perseus.  The
colored image is constructed from three separate images taken with
ultraviolet, green, and red filters.  The light is emitted by a hot,
rarefied plasma of gas that is being excited by embedded hot stars.
The reddish light is emitted by a combination of hydrogen and
nitrogen; the yellowish light is emitted by a combination of oxygen
and other elements.  Dust is mixed in with the glas, creating
silhouette patterns throughout the neubla.
