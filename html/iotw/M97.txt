The Owl Nebula (M97) is the spectacular remains of a sun-like star at the
end of its life. The parent star, buried in the center of this expanding
cloud of gas, exhausted its fuel for fusion several thousand years ago.
When this happened, the star collapsed to form a white dwarf and shed its
outer layers to create the nebula pictured here. Planetary nebulae do not
last forever -- as this shell of gas expands it will eventually become too
thin to see.
