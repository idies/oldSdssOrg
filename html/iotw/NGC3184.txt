With its striking spiral arms, NGC 3184 is a face-on galaxy in the 
constellation Ursa Major. In 1999 this galaxy was host to a supernova 
which originated in one of its star-forming regions. In SDSS images, 
star-forming regions show up as blue-green in color and as you can see 
from the image, this galaxy contains a wealth of them. As a result of active 
star formation, NGC 3184 is also known for its high abundance of heavy 
elements.
