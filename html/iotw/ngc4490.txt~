This pair of galaxies (NGC 4490 on the bottom) located in Canes Venatici form an astrophysical laboratory for studying interacting galaxies.  These two spiral galaxies are being pulled towards each other, distorting their shapes.  The pair has also undergone a recent collision, which touched off a spurt of star formation, as seen in the blue-green bright spots that are seen in both galaxies.
