The bar in NGC 4725 barred galaxy is relatively faint, and this galaxy
is therefore sometimes considered a borderline object between barred
and unbarred spirals. The bright blue spots in the spiral arms
indicate new star formation, because blue stars only live a short
time; in areas where there are only older stars, the blue stars have
already all died, and the galaxy appears more yellow. Dust lanes can
be seen against the background of the central bulge, and indicate
which is the near side of this galaxy.
