Shown is Arp 188, better known as the Tadpole galaxy.  This relatively nearby galaxy (at a distance of 420 million light years) has undergone a massive interaction in the recent past.  This gravitational struggle tore part of the Tadpole free, stripping gas away from the galaxy and touching off a torrent of star formation.  The not-so-friendly neighbor is positioned behind the Tadpole, barely discernible at the bottom-right of the galaxy.  These type of interactions are common in the Universe, as many galaxies observed with SDSS seem to have undergone an interaction in the past.
