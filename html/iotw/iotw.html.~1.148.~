Shown above are the spiral galaxies NGC 3788 (top) and NGC 3786 (bottom) in the constellation Ursa Major (home of the Big Dipper).  These two galaxies, like many found throughout the SDSS survey, are gravitationally interacting.  Interactions such as these are commonly observed by the SDSS.  They are thought to lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies, and it will probably be the fate of the Milky Way and M31 in the distant future.
