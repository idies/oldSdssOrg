While the SDSS camera does a great job at scanning the stars and galaxies of the Cosmos, it runs into problems when it tries to image moving objects, such as the meteor trail shown above.  Meteors are the result of small particles around the size of pebbles entering the Earth's atmosphere and burning up due to the large frictional forces by it.  Meteor showers, such as this summer's Perseids, occur when the Earth's orbit intersects debris left by a comet (in the Perseids case, it is Comet Swift-Tuttle), resulting in a proliferation of meteors.
