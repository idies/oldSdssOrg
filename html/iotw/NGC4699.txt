NGC 4699 is a tightly wound spiral galaxy 60 million light years away near 
the edge of the Virgo Cluster. Inside the very bright core is a hint of bar 
structure. In 1983, this galaxy was host to a type II supernova that, for 
the first time ever, was observed with high quality spectra before it 
reached maximum brightness. This gave astronomers new insights into the 
nature of the progenitors of this type of supernova, massive stars at the 
end of their lives.
