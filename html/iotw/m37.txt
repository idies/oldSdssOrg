Shown above is the open cluster, Messier 37.  Located about 4,000 light years away, this group of stars is in the constellation Auriga.  It is also among the older known open clusters known, and some of the brighter red stars in this image are evolved stars known as red giants.  The numerous bluer stars are less massive stars that are still on the main sequence.
