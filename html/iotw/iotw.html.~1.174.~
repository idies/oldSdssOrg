<p>
Shown is the spiral galaxy NGC 5792.  While the galaxy is a pretty typical spiral, almost edge-on, with blue spiral arms and some dust features, it is neighbored by a member of our own Milky Way, a red dwarf.  This star is less massive than the Sun, with a spectral type of M0.  M dwarfs are the most common type of star, making up about 75% of all stars in the Milky Way.  Yet, like the star in this image, most are too faint to be seen with the naked eye.  This once made M dwarfs strong candidates for dark matter, but this idea has been discarded.
