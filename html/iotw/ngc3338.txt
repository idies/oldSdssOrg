Shown is the spiral galaxy, NGC 3338.  This spiral galaxy is known as a grand design spiral, which describes the sweeping arms that are a dominant characteristic of these types of spirals.  Like most spirals, star formation is now occurring in the arms, with older stars providing the yellowish light emanating from the galaxy's core.  Explaining the global properties of galaxies, like color, is a complicated problem that includes stellar evolution, star formation and galactic environment, and is an active area of research for today's astronomers.
