NGC 4631, also called the Whale Galaxy because of its shape, is an
excellent example of an edge on disk galaxy being disturbed through
interactions with multiple other galaxies. Disruptions caused the
the asymmetric, whale-like appearance and probably contributed to
the significant star formation seen as blue knots in this image.
