Messier 81 is a gorgeous spiral galaxy 12 million light years away in the
constellation Ursa Major. The distance to M81 is one of the best
determined for a galaxy. This measurement was done using Cepheid
variables, stars that vary in brightness as they pulse in size over a
period of days. The absolute brightness of these stars is directly
correlated with their pulse period. By measuring the apparent brightness
and pulse periods of 30 Cepheids in M81 astronomers were able to calculate 
the distance to this galaxy.
