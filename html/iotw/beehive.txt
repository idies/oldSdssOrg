Messier 44, also know as Praesepe and the beehive clusters, is a famous cluster
of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy.  It is at a distance of about 180
parsecs in the constellation Cancer.  The stars all formed at nearly the
same time, about 800 million years ago.  The cluster includes many different
types of stars, including main sequence stars, red giants, and white dwarfs,
and is often studied by astronomers.

The Messier catalog was compiled by Charles Messier as an aid in finding
comets - most of the objects in his catalog are faint and nebulous in
appearance and easily mistaken for comets.  It is unclear why he included
this star cluster as object 44 since it is bright and was already well known.
