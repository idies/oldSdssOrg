Although relatively sparse compared to other globular clusters, NGC 5466
still shows the strong central concentration, spherical shape, and
greater size that distinguish globular clusters from open
clusters. Globular clusters are the oldest known structures in our
galaxy, and globular cluster studies provide essential data for
studying how stars age.
