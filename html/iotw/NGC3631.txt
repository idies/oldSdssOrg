NGC 3631 is another example of a "grand design" spiral galaxy seen
nearly face on. Two long, pronounced spiral arms, both with active
star formation, extend from close to the center out to the edges of
the galaxy. NGC 3631 is an ScII type galaxy according to its Hubble
classification and van den Bergh luminosity class: the S designates
that it is a spiral, the "c" that the arms are loosely wound, and the
"II" that it is moderately bright.
