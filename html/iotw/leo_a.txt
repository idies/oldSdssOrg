Shown is the dwarf irregular galaxy, Leo A.  This small galaxy is a neighbor of our Milky Way, at a distance of 2 million light years.  Because of their low surface densities, these galaxies were not studied in great numbers until recently.Yet, there are among the most common galaxies, and becoming increasingly important for understanding how galaxies like the Milky Way form.  These small galaxies are thought to be the building blocks of larger galaxies.
