Messier 95 is a typical example of a barred spiral galaxy.  Spiral
arms that appear to begin at the ends of the bar initially form a
tight ring before extending outward. Studies of variable stars in M95,
as measured in images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, play an
important role in determining the distance scale.
