Continuing with the theme of interacting spiral galaxies, we present the pair of NGC 3395 and NGC 3396.  Found in the constellation Leo Minor, these two sprial galaxies the classic sign of gravitational interactions, elongation in the direction of its partner.  Of particular interest are the knots of star formation that show up as turqouise blobs in this SDSS image.  The dominant source of light in these regions is thought to be provided by young, massive stars.
