Within the heart of the majestic spiral galaxy shown above, NGC 5033, lies a powerful engine.  This galaxy is one of the most commonly studied Seyfert galaxies.  Seyfert galaxies are a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN).  In particular, Seyferts produce large amounts of emission line spectra in their core, often with variable power. The driving source of this emission is thought to be a supermassive black hole, with a mass of at least 10 million solar masses.
