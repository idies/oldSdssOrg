The mosaic image above shows the Coma Cluster, a prototypical dense galaxy cluster.  The Coma cluster contains mostly elliptical galaxies, which appear as white-yellow blobs in this image.  In fact, most of the blobs in this image are galaxies.  This cluster has been studied extensively, both observationally and computationally, as large super-computer simulations attempt to recreate the general properties of this cluster.
