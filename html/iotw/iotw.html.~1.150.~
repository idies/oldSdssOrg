Shown is the globular cluster, M3.  One of the few hundred globular clusters in our Galaxy, this cluster is composed of mostly old, evolved stars.  Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the Galaxy, forming when the Milky Way was young.  First cataloged by Messier in 1764, this cluster contains hundreds of thousands of stars and is visible to the naked eye under dark skies.
