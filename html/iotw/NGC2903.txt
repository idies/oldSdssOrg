In the constellation Leo resides NGC 2903, a barred spiral galaxy. 
Infrared observations have revealed that star formation in this galaxy is
occurring in a ring around the center. Hubble Space Telescope images of NGC
2903 found that the strange hot spots near the galaxy's center are
actually bright young globular clusters, a striking contrast to the
uniformly old globular clusters in our own galaxy.
