The Cygnus region, shown above, is an area on the sky that is rich in gas, dust and stars.  The green nebulosity above is due mostly to the H alpha transition, and would appear red to the naked eye.  The dark columns running through the nebula are dense regions of dust and molecular gas, and they obscure the light being emitted by the gas.  This is the same process seen in the more famous Horsehead Nebula in Orion.
