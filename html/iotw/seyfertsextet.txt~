Shown is the galaxy group known as Seyfert's Sextet.  This group is found in the constellation Serpens.  Actually, there are only five main galaxies in this images and only four are interacting.  The face-on spiral that is in the "ring" of galaxies is actually a background object.  The wispy feature on the upper left is probably the remnant tidal tail of a past interaction, now just a loosely bound collection of gas and stars.  The remaining four galaxies are densely packed and undergoing strong gravitational interactions.
