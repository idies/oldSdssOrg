Shown is one of the handful of comets detected in the SDSS footprint, Comet 2001 RX14 (Linear).  This hyperbolic comet made one pass around the sun in 2003, and left the solar system, never to return again.  This comet reached a peak brightness of about 11, much fainter than Comet McNaught, which is currently dazzling skygazers around the globe.  Objects such as Comet RX14 are scattered into the inner solar system from the Oort Cloud, after being jostled by the gravitational tugs of the large, gas giant planets.
