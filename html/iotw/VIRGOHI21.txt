Radio telescopes at Arecibo and Jodrell Bank Observatory detect a
large cloud of hydrogen gas at the center of the region of the sky
covered by this image, but no corresponding objects can be seen in
it. The rotation of this cloud indicates the presence of a significant
mass of dark matter (matter that we cannot currently detect directly)
as well.
