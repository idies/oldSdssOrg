NGC 4636 is an elliptical galaxy about 50 million light years away in the 
constellation Virgo. Though it looks normal viewed here in the visible, 
in X-ray wavelengths NGC 4636 shows an extended halo of hot gas 
with pronounced arcs that extend out 25,000 light years from the center. 
These structures, which are unusual for an elliptical galaxy, may trace 
the leading edge of a galaxy-sized shock wave resulting from a titanic 
explosion in the core three million years ago.
