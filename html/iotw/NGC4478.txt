Elliptical galaxy NGC 4478 is a close companion of Messier 87, and
like other galaxies featured here, NGC 4478 is has been disturbed by
its larger neighbor. In this case, however, the disturbance is more
subtle. The light from most elliptical galaxies decreases smoothly as
one looks further and further from the center of the galaxy, and faint
light from a these galaxies can usually be seen extending far from the
center. In the case of NGC 4478, however, the light decreases smoothly
for a while, and then drops abruptly. Interaction with Messier 87 has
probably removed the matter that would have made up the outer regions
of this galaxy.
