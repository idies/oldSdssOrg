Shown is the open cluster NGC 6791, located in the constellation Lyra (part of the Summer triangle).  This particular cluster is useful as a strong observational test of stellar evolution theory, since it is one of the oldest open clusters around, with an age about twice that of our Sun.  Most open clusters are shredded by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way, or encounters with other massive objects, such as giant molecular clouds.  Fortunately, NGC 6791 has avoided this fate and has an important spot in the observer's toolbox.
