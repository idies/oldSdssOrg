The SDSS imaging camera collects data using array of 30 CCD's arranged
in six columns. Each of the five rows collects data through a different
filter. An additional 24 CCD's are arranged before and after these to
measure the positions of bright stars, allowing more precise
determination of the telescope pointing.
