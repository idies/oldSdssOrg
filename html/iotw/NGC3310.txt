NGC 3310 is a spiral galaxy with plenty of active star formation
surrounded by much fainter structures. The linear structure (perhaps a jet)
running from the center to the lower right of this image, together
with the faint arc it crosses, have resulted in NGC 3310 being called
the "bow and arrow" galaxy.
