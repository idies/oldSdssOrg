NGC 4449 is an irregular galaxy similar in size and morphology to our close 
neighbor to the south, the Large Magellanic Cloud. Residing in the 
constellation Canes Venatici, NGC 4449 has bright clouds of ionized 
hydrogen seen near the bottom of the image. Within these clouds of 
hydrogen are regions of on-going star formation.
