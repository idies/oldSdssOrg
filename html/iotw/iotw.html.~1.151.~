The swirling gas and dark dust lanes of the nebula NGC 2264 is shown above.  The light being produced in this image has two sources.  First, the bright stars in the image are ionizing nearby hydrogen gas, which re-emits light as it cools back down.  Additionally, the gas and dust scatters some of the starlight, in much the same way the Earth's atmosphere scatters blue light, producing our blue skies.
