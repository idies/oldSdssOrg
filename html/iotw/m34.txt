Shown above are the stellar members of the open cluster Messier 34.  Most open clusters are younger than the Sun, and thus their more massive stars are still on the main sequence.  Many of the blue and purple stars in this image are more massive than the Sun.  Their color indicates that these stars are hotter than the Sun and burning through their fuel more rapidly.  This rapid production of energy directly contributes to their short lifetimes.  These stars really do live fast and die young!
