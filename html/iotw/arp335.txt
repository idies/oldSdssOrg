The galaxy shown above is Arp 335, also known as NGC 3509.  This spiral galaxy is peculiar in that it is dominated by one large arm, probably formed in a collision with another galaxy.  Like most galaxies, Arp 335 shows the effects of a gravitational interaction.  These types of interactions are actively being explored by observers and theorists, as they play a large role in explaining why the galaxies we see today look the way they do.
