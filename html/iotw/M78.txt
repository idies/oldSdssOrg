M78 (also known as NGC 2068) is a reflection nebula in the Orion 
constellation. Hot young stars in the nebula's center illuminate the 
surrounding gas. Further out, dark clouds of dust prevent much of the 
scattered light from reaching us, creating a complex pattern of light and 
shadow. This star-forming region is only about 100,000 years old.
