This picturesque grouping of galaxies, known as Stephen's Quintet, is
found in the constellation Pegasus. Of the five galaxies in Stephen's
Quintet, four are involved in a massive collision (the spiral galaxy at
the bottom is a foreground object).  Earlier this year, Spitzer Space
Telescope observations of this group found one of the biggest shock waves
ever seen. NGC7318b, the right of the two small bright regions in the
center of the image, is colliding with the hydrogen gas spread throughout
the cluster.
