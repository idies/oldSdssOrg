Adding to its collection of planetary nebulae, the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey recently imaged this object: H 3-29. At the center is GL Tauri, a 
variable star that has blown off an expanding cloud gas seen here as the 
blue-green haze around the star. Planetary nebulae are short-lived 
objects, lasting only a few thousand years, which makes them rare.
