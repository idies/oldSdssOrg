Shown is the planetary nebula, NGC 6058.  Like most planetary nebulae, this object is the death-throes of star like our own Sun.  As solar-type stars reach the end of their lifetimes, they begin to push off their outer layers, which are seen in this image as blue.  This layer is mostly hydrogen and helium, and is excited by radiation being emitted by the remnant of the stellar core, known as a white dwarf.
