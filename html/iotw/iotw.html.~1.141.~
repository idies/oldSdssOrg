<p> 
This group of three galaxies in the constellation Leo (aka the Trio in Leo) is composed of two spiral galaxies (NGC 3190 at the center of the image, NGC 3187 at the left of the image).  The non-descript elliptical galaxy NGC 3193 is located at the left side of the image.  These galaxies are members of Hickson Compact Group 44, compiled by Canadian astronomer Paul Hickson.  These groups are thought to have interacted in the past (as have most galaxies) and NGC 3190 exhibits some traces of a past interaction with NGC 3187.
