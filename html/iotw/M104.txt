Messier 104, nicknamed the Sombrero Galaxy, is an unusual spiral
galaxy with both a large central bulge and a prominent, dusky disk,
which we see nearly edge-on. A large system of globular clusters
resides in this galaxy. These clusters appear as star-like point
sources because they are so far away. Messier 104 was also the origin
of several important historical discoveries: it was the first galaxy
in which dust lanes were seen, and also the first in which rotation
was detected.
