NGC 3626 is a spiral galaxy with a striking dust lane encircling its
central bulge. This galaxy is unusual in that the gas in the galaxy
rotates counter to the rotation of the stars. How this situation
occurred is unclear; one speculation is that the galaxy itself
recently merged with a large cloud of gas.
