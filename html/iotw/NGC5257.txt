Galaxies lead very active lives. In this image NGC 5257 and 5258, 
two spiral galaxies in the constellation Virgo, are seen in the midst of a 
collision that has taken on the order of a billion years. As a result, a dim 
bridge of stars is now stretched between them and both are actively 
forming new stars in their disks. The shapes of galaxies after a collision 
depend on the collision geometry and the masses of the galaxies.

Chris Mihos of Case Western Reserve University, together with colleagues 
at the University of Oregon, has created a java applet that lets you crash 
galaxies together. Try different collision geometries and masses to see if 
you can reproduce the collision seen in this image.
