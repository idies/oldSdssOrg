The Hercules Galaxy Cluster - a cosmic Easter Egg hunt! How many galaxies 
can you find? This cluster, about 650 million light years away in the 
constellation Hercules, is rich in spiral galaxies. See if you can find 
three pairs of colliding spiral galaxies. For a harder challenge, try to 
spot the foreground stars which reside in our own galaxy. This cluster of 
galaxies is a part of the Hercules supercluster which is a part of the 
Great Wall, a gigantic chain of galaxy clusters that is half a billion light 
years long.
