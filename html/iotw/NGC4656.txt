NGC 4656 is a peculiar spiral galaxy in Canes Venatici. Dubbed the Hockey 
Stick, this galaxy has been disturbed by neighboring NGC 4631. A tenuous  
bridge of hydrogen gas connecting the two, visible at the 21cm 
wavelength, provides evidence for the interaction. In this image knots of 
star forming regions are visible on the warped side.
