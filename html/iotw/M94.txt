Messier 94, nicknamed the Croc's Eye Galaxy, is another face-on spiral
galaxy with an unusual star forming pattern. The center itself is very
bright, and it is surrounded by a blue ring of recently formed stars.
Spiral arms and dust lanes extend from the center well past the ring. 
A second, very faint ring can be seen surrounding the galaxy, just barely
visible in this image.
