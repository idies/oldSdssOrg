Title: VV150b

Caption: The 5 brightest galaxies form a compact group of galaxies that
likely form a gravitationally bound system.  All have velocities of about
8000 km/s.  The group is known as VV150b and also Arp 322.  Tidal interactions
give rise to the streamers of material that appear to connect some of the
galaxies.  By accurately measuring the velocities of the galaxies with respect
to one another, it is possible to estimate the total mass of such groups.
