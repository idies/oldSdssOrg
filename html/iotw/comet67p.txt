Shown is the Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as imaged by the SDSS telescope.  This short-period comet orbits the Sun every 6.6 years, and it has become the focus of an ambitious space mission, Rosetta, which is being operated by the European Space Agency.  This past Sunday, the Rosetta spacecraft performed a gravity-assisted flyby of Mars, using the Red Planet's gravity to slingshot it towards the comet.  In 2014, the spacecraft will catch up to the 4 km object, and perform the first controlled landing on one of these icy bodies.
