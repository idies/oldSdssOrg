This unassuming cluster of stars centered in the above image led to one of the many exciting results from early SDSS observations.  Palomar 5, a halo globular cluster, is being shredded apart by the gravitational pull of the Milky Way.  Thus, the cluster contains relatively few stars in its core, with more mass actually being distributed in tidal tails.  These tails are streams of stars being pulled off Palomar 5 along its orbit, and provide an active example of a mechanism that is suspected to play an important role in the evolution of our Galaxy.
