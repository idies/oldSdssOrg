Messier 98 is another spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster.  The
velocity at which an astronomical object is moving toward or away from
us can usually be accurately measured, because this motion causes the
light from it to appear more red (if it is moving away from us) or blue
(if it is moving toward us) that it would if it were not moving. Most
galaxies are found to be moving away from us due to the expansion of
the universe. This expansion, however, is not the only factor in
determining the velocity of a galaxy; it may, for example, be falling
toward other galaxies, or clusters of galaxies, and so there are a few
cases where the galaxy is actually moving toward us. Messier 98 is
one of these cases.
