Shown is one of the more prominent globular clusters in the Northern night sky, Messier 13, in Hercules.  This cluster is one of the brightest clusters, and is often one of the first stops for a beginning observer.  Visible in the summer sky, this cluster is about 6 visual magnitudes, and will be barely visible with the naked eye from dark skies.  M13 was also one of the first targets for potential contact with other civilizations, as it was beamed a radio message from the Arecibo Observatory in 1974.
