NGC 4964 is an impressive face on spiral galaxy with many
broken spiral arms. The colors of the different parts of the galaxy
show differences in star formation history: the reddish color of
the central bulge indicates that it is older than the disk, while the
blue spots in the disk, particularly in the arms, show where new star
formation is taking place. This pattern is typical of spiral galaxies.
