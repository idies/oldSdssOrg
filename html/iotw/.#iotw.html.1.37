<p>Messier 87 is a giant elliptical galaxy with several distinctive
features. Found near the center of the the largest component of the
Virgo cluster of galaxies, it is also one of its largest
members. Several companion galaxies are evident, as is a large
population of globular clusters. These clusters make the galaxy appear
covered in glowing freckles.</p>

<p>M87 has a prominent jet (pointing slightly right of down in this
image) and an active nucleus, thought to contain a massive black
hole.
