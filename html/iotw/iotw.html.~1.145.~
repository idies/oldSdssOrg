Shown is the galaxy pair NGC 3227 (bottom) and NGC 3226 (top).  NGC 3227 is a spiral galaxy, which is interacting with the dwarf elliptical NGC 3226.  The spiral galaxy is home to an active galactic nucleus, which is a high-energy source that is thought to be powered by a black hole.  As the accretion disk around the black hole is heated, it produces X-rays.  Also, as seen in other images of the week, galaxy interactions are common, as most galaxies are found in groups.
