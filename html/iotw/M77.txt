Late March marks a special time of year when ambitious astronomers in North 
America can look at all 110 of the Messier objects in a single night. 
This year, the weekends of March 25/26 and April 1/2 were the best weekends 
for attempting the Messier marathon. If you were going in 
order then you would have encountered this object, M77, early in the 
night. M77, also known as NGC 1068, is a spiral galaxy in the constellation 
Cetus. It is the nearest and brightest example of a Seyfert II galaxy.
