This image of the globular cluster NGC 288 came from the SDSS
photometric telescope. Globular clusters are centrally concentrated
spherical collections of stars, typically numbering in the hundreds of
thousands. Note that NGC 288 contains stars with a variety of colors
and luminosities. Because the stars in a globular cluster are formed
at the same time, from the same cloud of gas, and are at the same
distance, these differences are not due to age, initial composition,
or distance, but mass.
