M31, better known as the Andromeda galaxy, is our nearest spiral neighbor. 
Visible to the naked eye on a clear moonless night, M31 appears nearly
three degrees wide in our sky -- that's six times the width of the full
moon! Because of M31's large angular size, this picture was created by
stitching together data from multiple SDSS images. A new dwarf spheroidal
galaxy was recently discovered in M31 using SDSS photometry data and
follow-up observations. This puts the count at 10 known satellite galaxies
contained within M31.
