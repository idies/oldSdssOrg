At the recent American Astronomical Society meeting held in Seattle, Washington, astronomers from all over the country gathered to discuss and present the latest in fields ranging from exoplanets to flaring stars to the formation of galaxies.  The SDSS has had a broad impact on astronomy, and highlighted some of the major efforts of the collaboration with a booth at the meeting.  In this picture,(chef) Jordan Raddick of Johns Hopkins University explains some of the resources available to the public for exploring the SDSS database.  Many of these sites are linked from the Education page on the main SDSS webpage.
