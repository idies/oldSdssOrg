Shown is the nebula NGC 1491, located in the constellation Perseus.  This nebula is being actively shaped by the bright star located to left of center in this image.  The star is ionizing the surrounding hydrogen gas, resulting in a reddish color tint to the nebula.  One can also see the bubble being cleared out by the star as it blows out its local surroundings.
