NGC 4438 (upper left) and NGC 4435 (lower right) are two members of the
Virgo cluster of galaxies. The blue filaments extending from NGC 4438
indicate disruption from recent interaction with another galaxy. The
obvious candidate is NGC 4435, but spectroscopic observations indicate
that these two galaxies may be moving past each other too quickly too
have such a strong interaction; NGC 4486 (M87) is another good
candidate for the disrupting influence.
