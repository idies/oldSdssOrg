Shown is the asteroid 2007 WD5, which was imaged by the SDSS telescope on Nov. 8th.  This asteroid is special, because on January 30th, 2008, there is a 4% chance that it will impact Mars.  Before this SDSS observation was used, there was only about a 1% chance of this impact.  More measurements of the position of this asteroid are needed to measure its exact motion, in order to know if it will impact Mars.  If the asteroid does hit Mars, it will probably leave a crater about a kilometer in size.
