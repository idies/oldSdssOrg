<p>
Shown above is the planetary nebula G164.8+31.1, with its strange name being derived from its position on the sky.  Planetary nebula is a misnomer, as these complexes of gas have little to do with actual planets.  They are the last evolutionary steps of stars similar to the Sun, and the circular gas shell you see in green and blue is actually the outer layers of a solar-type star, whose core is now the bluish white star at the center of the image.  This remnant core is known as a white dwarf, and contains about sixth tenths of the mass of the Sun, but is only the size of the Earth.
