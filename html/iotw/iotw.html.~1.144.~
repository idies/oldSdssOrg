Shown is the galaxy cluster, AWM 7, with the dominant elliptical galaxy NGC 1129 at its center.  Elliptical galaxies, in contrast to the spiral and irregular galaxies shown in past weeks are composed of mostly older stellar populations. These stars are older than our Sun, moving towards the end of their luminous lives.These galaxies are often found in dense environments, as shown here.  Most of the major galaxies in this image are elliptical galaxies, which are thought to be the end product of a merger between spiral galaxies.
