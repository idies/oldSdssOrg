The object of interest in this image is a set of faint, blue, green, and red
streaks in the upper half of the picture.  This object is an asteroid
passing close to the earth at high angular velocity.  It moved from
right to left during the 5 minutes that this image was taken.  Since each
piece of sky is imaged in 5 filters in succession, the object showed up in
different locations in each of the different filters.  Only 3 of the 5
filters are used to make this image, giving rise to the 3 colored streaks.

Near earth objects are rocks ranging in size from
meters to kilometers. These objects are very important because of
their likelihood of impacting the Earth.  The photometric data
provided by SDSS will be invaluable for linking near earth objects to
their parent populations.  Possible places they may have come from
include the asteroid belt and extinct cometary nuclei.
