The Pinwheel Galaxy, also known as Messier 101 and NGC 5457, is a face-on 
spiral in the constellation Ursa Major. Though M101 extends over 22 arc 
minutes in the sky, only the central region of this Sc type galaxy is 
visible here. Its spiral arms are marked with clumps of bright young 
stars and dark dust lanes.
