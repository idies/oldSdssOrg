Shown is the halo globular cluster, Messier 2, in Aquarius.  This was originally cataloged by Jean-Dominique Maraldi, and later re-discovered by Messier.  Like many of the Messier objects, M2 is visible in small telescopes (or by the naked eye in dark skies). Globular clusters have been a observational workhorse in Astronomy, testing stellar evolutionary models, being used to determine the center of the Milky Way and determining the age of the Galaxy, among other important roles.
