Comets are traditionally named after their discoverers. Comet
62P/Tsuchinshan is named after Purple Mountain observatory, at which
it was discovered. The 62P designation identifies it as a short
period comet. Periodic comets have elliptical orbits, which fade
from view and then reappear as their orbits take them closer and
further from the sun. 62P/Tsuchinshan has a relatively short period of
roughly 7 years; other periodic comets have much longer periods of
hundreds of years.
