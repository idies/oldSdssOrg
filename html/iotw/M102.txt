The most contended of the original Messier objects, M102 was considered 
"missing" for a long time due to an error in its recorded position. In a 
rush to publish, Charles Messier did not double check the positions of 
his last three Messier objects: M101, M102 and M103. For a while M102 was 
thought to be a duplicate entry for M101 but it is now thought to be this 
object, an edge-on spiral galaxy between the stars Omicron Bootis and 
Iota Draconis.
