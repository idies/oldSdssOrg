Spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is often overlooked in favor of the nearby Leo 
triplet. But if you're an amateur astronomer with a telescope, this 
lovely galaxy is worth the hunt. At a magnitude of 8.9, it has a bright 
concentration in the middle and a dark band of dust blocking light from 
the near side. As you can see in this image, NGC 3521 also displays a 
magnificent halo of matter ejected from the disk.
