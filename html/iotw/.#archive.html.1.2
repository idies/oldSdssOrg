<h2>Messier 87</h2>
<p>
       Messier 87 is a giant elliptical galaxy with several distinctive
features. Found near the center of the the largest component of the
Virgo cluster of galaxies, it is also one of its largest
members. Several companion galaxies are evident, as is a large
population of globular clusters. These clusters make the galaxy appear
covered in glowing freckles.

M87 has a prominent jet (pointing slightly right of down in this
image) and an active nucleus, thought to contain a massive black
hole.

<h2>Messier 64</h2>
<p>
       The spiral galaxy M64 appears highly inclined, but not edge on. The
prominant dust lanes have earned it a nickname: "The Black Eye
Galaxy."

<h2>NGC 7814</h2>
<p>
       NGC 7814 is a disk galaxy seen edge on. From this angle, we cannot
determine whether it has a spiral structure. This image shows clearly
the dust in its disk and its bright central bulge. The brightest
globular clusters associated with NGC 7814 can also be seen; they
appear as point sources near the galaxy.

<h2>IZw18</h2>
<p>
       Because blue stars have short lifetimes, the blue color of this galaxy
indicates that most of the light from this galaxy is from recently
formed stars. Spectra of IZw18 show few heavy elements, providing
additional evidence that the stars in this galaxy are young; older
stars would have generated more heavy elements. It has therefore been
heavily studied to improve our understanding of star formation in
primordial conditions.

<h2>VIRGOHI21</h2>
<p>
       Radio telescopes at Arecibo and Jodrell Bank Observatory detect a
large cloud of hydrogen gas at the center of the region of the sky
covered by this image, but no corresponding objects can be seen in
it. The rotation of this cloud indicates the presence of a significant
mass of dark matter (matter that we cannot currently detect directly)
as well.

<h2>NGC 288</h2>
<p>
       This image of the globular cluster NGC 288 came from the SDSS
photometric telescope. Globular clusters are centrally concentrated
spherical collections of stars, typically numbering in the hundreds of
thousands. Note that NGC 288 contains stars with a variety of colors
and luminosities. Because the stars in a globular cluster are formed
at the same time, from the same cloud of gas, and are at the same
distance, these differences are not due to age, initial composition,
or distance, but mass.

<h2>NGC 4438 and NGC 4435</h2>
<p>
       NGC 4438 (upper left) and NGC 4435 (lower right) are two members of the
Virgo cluster of galaxies. The blue filaments extending from NGC 4438
indicate disruption from recent interaction with another galaxy. The
obvious candidate is NGC 4435, but spectroscopic observations indicate
that these two galaxies may be moving past each other too quickly too
have such a strong interaction; NGC 4486 (M87) is another good
candidate for the disrupting influence.

<h2>NGC 1491</h2>
<p>
       This object is an HII region in the constellation Perseus.  The
colored image is constructed from three separate images taken with
ultraviolet, green, and red filters.  The light is emitted by a hot,
rarefied plasma of gas that is being excited by embedded hot stars.
The reddish light is emitted by a combination of hydrogen and
nitrogen; the yellowish light is emitted by a combination of oxygen
and other elements.  Dust is mixed in with the glas, creating
silhouette patterns throughout the neubla.

<h2>Messier 44</h2>
<p>
       Messier 44, also know as Praesepe and the beehive clusters, is a famous cluster
of stars in our own Milky Way galaxy.  It is at a distance of about 180
parsecs in the constellation Cancer.  The stars all formed at nearly the
same time, about 800 million years ago.  The cluster includes many different
types of stars, including main sequence stars, red giants, and white dwarfs,
and is often studied by astronomers.

The Messier catalog was compiled by Charles Messier as an aid in finding
comets - most of the objects in his catalog are faint and nebulous in
appearance and easily mistaken for comets.  It is unclear why he included
this star cluster as object 44 since it is bright and was already well known.

<h2>NGC 2403</h2>
<p>
       This splendid spiral galaxy is located in the constellation
Camelopardus (the Giraffe).  It is a member of a group of galaxies that also
includes Messier 81 and Messier 82.  Galaxies come in a wide range of sizes;
NGC 2403 is about in the middle of the pack.  It has no central bulge to
speak of, but does exhibit a large number of HII regions (the knots
sprinkled throughout the spiral arms) and several small lanes of dust.
