Shown above is the open cluster known as Messier 67.  Open clusters are groups of stars that have no ongoing star formation, but are loosely gravitationally bound to each other.  M67 is one of the older open clusters known, with an age slightly older than our own Sun.  Clusters are useful astronomical laboratory since all of the stars are the same age and about the same distance from us, eliminating some of the issues when studying stars spread over the sky.
