<h2>Sloan Digital Sky Survey: A Resource for High School and College 
Classrooms</h2>
<h3>A workshop for educators who work with students in grades 11-12 and 
up.<br>
June 30, 2006, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Johnson Hall 366 and 341 on the UW 
campus</h3> 

<p> 
<b>Introduction</b><br>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a huge database of astronomical 
information that has resulted from doing imaging in five colors of all 
the sky that is visible from a 2.5-m telescope in south central New 
Mexico. In addition, the SDSS has obtained hundreds of thousands of 
spectra of stars, galaxies and other objects with that same telescope. 
This database of astronomical information is available to anyone who 
would like to use it. In particular, educators can use it to do classroom 
exercises and projects on topics such as the spectra of stars, the nature 
of galaxies, the expansion of the universe and others. A bonus is that 
SDSS scientists have developed some educational materials such as 
visualizations of the structure of the universe and explanations of the 
SDSS science goals and how the project has been carried that are useful 
for high school and college classrooms. This workshop will give educators 
an introduction to SDSS education materials.

<b>Objectives/Outcomes</b><br>
As a result of attending this workshop, participants should<br>
<ol type="1">
<li> Learn about the major science objectives and methods of the 
SDSS

<li> Learn what is involved in doing a SkyServer education exercise in 
their class(es) by spending time working on two of the exercises in a 
computer laboratory.
<li> Learn what resources are available for their classes (visualizations
