<h2>What is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey?</h2>
</div>
<p>Simply put, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is the most ambitious
astronomical survey project ever undertaken.  The survey will map in
detail one-quarter of the entire sky, determining the positions and
absolute brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects.  It
will also measure the distances to more than a million galaxies and
quasars.  Apache Point Observatory, site of the SDSS telescopes, is
operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC).</p>
<p>The SDSS addresses fascinating, fundamental questions about the
universe.  With the survey, astronomers will be able to see the
large-scale patterns of galactic sheets and voids in the universe.
Scientists have varying ideas about the evolution of the universe, and
different patterns of large-scale structure point to different theories
of how the universe evolved.  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey will tell us
which theories are right -- or whether we have to come up with entirely
new ideas.</p>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a joint project of The
University of Chicago, Fermilab, the Institute for Advanced Study, the
Japan Participation Group, The Johns Hopkins University, 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy (MPIA), the Max-Planck-Institute for
Astrophysics (MPA), New Mexico State University, University of Pittsburgh,  
Princeton University, 
the United States Naval Observatory, and the University of Washington.
</p>
<p>Funding for the project has been provided by the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, the Participating Institutions, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the
U.S. Department of Energy, the Japanese Monbukagakusho, and the Max
Planck Society.</p>
<p>www.sdss.org is a winner of the
<a href="http://www.GriffithObs.org/StarAward.html"> 
Griffith Observatory's Star Award</a>
