The bottom panel shows the sky coverage of the final SDSS imaging survey, including data from
SDSS I, II, and III.
</p>

<p>
SDSS imaging covered slightly more than 1/3
of the sky, concentrated in the northern and southern Galactic caps (above and 
below the plane of the galaxy).
In this image, stripes are radiating out from these caps; these stripes are areas imaged by the 
SEGUE survey, extending toward the plane of the Milky Way. 
Each orange dot in this map is a galaxy.
</p>

<p>
The sequence of zooms in the upper panels zeroes in on the
star-forming nebula NGC 604 in the nearby (2.5 million light years) galaxy
Messier 33.  In all, the SDSS imaging map shown here contains more than a trillion pixels, 
each one imaged in five colors.
