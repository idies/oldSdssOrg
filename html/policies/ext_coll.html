Non-Participants
</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.1">Section 4.1</a> of the <a
href="sdss_poo.html">SDSS Principles of Operation (PoO)</a> states that
data rights are in the hands of scientists at an SDSS institution
("Participants") who have PI status or whose primary responsibility is
the construction of the SDSS, and of individuals at other institutions
granted such Participant status.  <a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.2">Section
4.2 of the PoO</a> describes the principles under which SDSS data may be
used collaboratively by non-Participants prior to public release.  The
purpose of this document is to define efficient procedures for
implementing this section of the PoO.  The procedures are slightly
different for "inside" collaborators, who are at SDSS institutions, and
for "outside" collaborators, who are not.  See also <a
href="data_access.html">"SDSS Data Access by Graduate Students and
Postdocs"</a>.</p>

<p>Examples of the kinds of collaborations covered by this policy
include:
<ul>
<li>follow-up observations of interesting SDSS objects with larger
telescopes or at other wavelengths;

<li>use of SDSS data in generating observing proposals for space
observatories (e.g., AXAF), in collaboration with some non-SDSS
astronomers;

<li>searching the SDSS catalogues for objects with the color
signature of some particular type of object (e.g., T Tauri stars), in
collaboration with a non-SDSS scientist who has devised an efficient
search algorithm;

<li>comparison of the SDSS luminosity functions for galaxies with data
on faint galaxies observed at Keck;

<li>comparison of SDSS data to data from other surveys (e.g., 2MASS) in
a particular area of the sky;

<li>comparison of SDSS star counts with a new model for the Galaxy;
</ul>and so on.</p>

<h2>"Inside" Collaborations</h2>

<p>In practice, much of the scientific analysis of the SDSS data will be
done by students and postdocs at SDSS institutions.  These "inside"
collaborators access the data through individuals at their institution
with data rights.  These individuals (i.e., the graduate and postdoctoral
advisors) are responsible for ensuring that their collaborators read and
agree to the <a href="sdss_poo.html">PoO</a> and <a
href="pub_policy.html">publication policy</a>, and they are responsible
for ensuring that these policies are followed and that the data are not
released outside the collaboration.  They and their institutions are
also responsible for providing the necessary research support:
computing, page charges, trips to scientific meetings, and so forth.</p>

<p>Because collaborative work with students and postdocs will be the
norm rather than the exception, no special permission is required to
initiate such collaborations.  However, as with all SDSS investigations,
a team contact should provide notice to the collaboration upon the
initiation of any project that is expected to lead ultimately to a
publication, as described in <a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.3.1">Section
4.3.1 of the PoO</a> and <a href="pub_policy.html#sec8.1">Section 8.1
of the Publication Policy</a>.  Such notification is especially
important in the case of Ph.D. theses, so that those concerned are aware
of any potential conflicts with other projects.  The notification of
initiation of an investigation should be submitted by an individual with
data rights and should list all of the student, postdoctoral, and other
collaborators.  By submitting the notification, the individual with data
rights implicitly accepts responsibility for ensuring that SDSS policies
are followed by the non-Participants who are collaborating on the
project.</p>


<h2>External Collaborations with those leaving SDSS institutions</h2>

<p>An individual at an SDSS institution who is working on projects
involving SDSS data and leaves that SDSS institution may request
External Collaborator status for those particular projects, so that
he/she may continue working on them after he/she leaves.  The request
shall be made to the Chair of the Collaboration Council, and the
decision will be made by the Management Committee in consultation with
the leaders of the projects involved, the relevant working group chairs,
and the CoCo.  Normally, External Collaborator status will be granted
provided that the individual has had significant involvement in the
project before he/she leaves.  This policy applies to faculty, postdocs,
and graduate students.  Individuals with portable data rights
(participant status), of course, need not make such a request.</p>


<h2>"Outside" Collaborations</h2>

<p>Collaborations involving colleagues not at an SDSS institution and
visitors at SDSS institutions (hereafter non-SDSS scientists) are
treated differently.  These collaborators will again access the
data through Participants with data rights.  At the initiation of such
collaborations, the SDSS scientist(s) involved should:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li><p>Inform the non-SDSS scientist(s) of the SDSS rules and guidelines
(the PoO, the Publication Policy, and this Collaboration Policy) and
obtain his/her consent to abide by them.  In particular, non-SDSS
scientists should understand and agree that they may not disseminate the
SDSS data to which they have access in any way, and that publications
resulting from the collaboration will be subject to the Publication
Policy.</p></li>

<li><p>Request comment and input from the relevant working groups (by
e-mail to the relevant sdss- working group archives); this step is
strongly encouraged.</p></li>

<li><p>Obtain permission to proceed from the Collaboration Council
(CoCo) by submitting a proposal.  In an e-mail message sent to
<kbd>sdss-general</kbd> and to the chair of the CoCo
(<kbd>coco@coltrane.uchicago.edu</kbd>), the SDSS Participant(s)
involved should briefly describe the proposed project, list the names
and institutions of the proposed collaborators, and state their
willingness to ensure that the outside collaboration will proceed
according to the SDSS rules, policies and guidelines.  Most important,
they should indicate what special resources or expertise the outside
collaborators bring to the project (e.g., telescope access, experience
with specific analysis techniques).  This justification for inclusion of
external collaborators should be a labeled, separate paragraph of the
proposal so that it can be clearly evaluated.</p>

<p>Permission can be expected in all cases where the outside collaborators
bring resources or expertise that are not readily available within the
SDSS collaboration itself. The guiding principle in these matters is to
allow SDSS Participants the first opportunity to carry out science
involving SDSS data, and to bring in outside collaborators only when
necessary to get the science done in the pre-release period.  Multiple
collaborations pursuing similar ends are allowed, so the establishment
of one outside collaboration does not preclude another along similar
lines.</p>

<p>Since collaborations involving non-participants require permission
from the Collaboration Council, postings should be phrased as
"proposals" rather than as "announcements", to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Objections to or comments on External Collaboration proposals from
members of the collaboration or from the working group chairs should be
forwarded to the CoCo chair within two weeks of the proposal's posting
on sdss-general.  Normally, the CoCo chair has four weeks to notify
proposers of approval or of any objections to the proposed
collaboration, consulting with other CoCo members, working group chairs,
etc., as he/she deems necessary.  If the CoCo decides that it needs more
time to consider a given proposal, it may extend the time frame (within
reason) and give notice to the project team of the new decision
date.</p>
 
<p>Rarely, proposals involving external collaborators will be
time-critical "targets of opportunity" which require faster decision
times.  In these cases, the CoCo shall make every effort to respond to
proposals within 10 days.  Such time-critical proposals should be
identified as such, and justification for the rapid time frame should be
spelled out.  Faster approval will only be given if a compelling case is
made.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Once a project involving external collaborators is approved, the
participants involved should:</p>

<ol type="1" start="4">
<li><p>Post notice of the proposed project(s) to the Publication
Archive, as per usual.</p></li>

<li><p>Post papers resulting from such collaborations to the SDSS
collaboration and invite authorship, as for an "internal" SDSS paper,
and be sure the outside collaborators understand in advance that this
will take place.</p></li>

<li><p>Send a brief annual progress report to the Collaboration Council
(<kbd>coco@coltrane.uchicago.edu</kbd>) outlining progress made, future
plans, and specifying the contributions made by the external
collaborators.</p></li>

</ol>
   
<p>If a project involving external collaborators is not approved by
CoCo, the project team may appeal the decision to the Management
Committee.</p>

<p>If a project is not approved and moves ahead in any case (e.g.,
follow-up observations are taken), the participants involved will be
deemed to be in violation of this policy only if a publication results
or if a public announcement of the results is made. At that time, the
CoCo chair will inform the Management Committee that those involved are
deemed to be in violation of the SDSS PoO.</p>

Participants, see the policy on <a href="data_access.html">Data Access
by Students and Postdocs</a>.</p>
