Policy on Continuing Participant Status After Departure from an SDSS
Institution

<p>According to the <a href="sdss_poo.html">Principles of Operation
(PoO)</a> of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, all Ph.D. level scientific
staff of the participating departments of the ARC institutions are
Participants (meaning that the core data, as defined in the PoO, is open
to them). Similar arrangements, specified in the respective MOUs,
identify Ph.D. scientists at the other institutions (Fermilab, JPG,
Max-Planck, and USNO) who are Participants.</p>

<p>A fundamental principle of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey collaboration
is that Participants who make significant contributions to the survey
and leave the participating institutions will retain this status. The
same general principle applies to individuals at all levels (i.e.,
tenured faculty as well as non-tenured scientists). Significant
contributions include, but are not limited to, the following: software
development, instrumentation, scientific contributions or leadership,
and fund-raising. Generally, a significant contribution will have a
value to the project that exceeds the equivalent of one year of
full-time effort. In the case that contributions do not qualify for
Participant status, the individual can apply for External Collaborator
status on specific projects he or she is involved in, as described in <a
href="ext_coll.html">Procedures for Early Collaborative Use of SDSS Data
with Non-Participants</a>.</p>

<p>It is especially important to ensure that a fair and equitable
procedure exists to confer the retention of Participant status in the
case of those non-tenured scientists who make significant contributions
to the project, since they are more likely to leave a participating
institution prior to the completion of the survey.</p>

<p>When a Participant is leaving a participating institution, the
following procedure should be followed: If the Participant is a
non-tenured scientist, the individual's faculty mentor, in consultation
with the individual, will write a letter of support to the Chair of the
Collaboration Council (CoCo) outlining the request for the retention of
Participant status and its rationale, as well as outlining the
individual's plans for future involvement in the SDSS. An additional
outside letter (i.e. from a senior scientist at another SDSS
institution) supporting the request should also be sent to the CoCo
Chair. The CoCo Chair will forward the request to the Management Council
(MC). The MC, with input from the CoCo as needed, will then determine
whether Participant status will be retained. It is important that the
faculty mentor meet with the individual on a regular basis (i.e.  not
just when departure is imminent) to keep the non-tenured scientist
apprised of how his/her contributions to the SDSS are viewed and of
prospects for the retention of Participant status upon departure.</p>

<p>In the case of a departing tenured faculty member, the individual
should write directly to the CoCo Chair outlining the request and plans
for future involvement in the SDSS. The CoCo Chair will then decide what
additional material (if any) it requires in order to judge the
contribution of the individual. Again, the decision will be made by the
MC.</p>

<p>The decision about the 'portability' of Participant status will
normally be made as an individual's departure approaches. An individual
who has made a contribution with a value exceeding the equivalent of two
years of full-time effort may request an early (pre-departure)
decision. The process to be followed is identical to the above. If the
MC does not grant such a request, the denial shall not prejudice future
requests to retain Participant status.</p>

<p>Those who have made significant contributions to the survey which do
not exceed the equivalent of one year of full-time effort may request
provisional Participant status by the same procedures as above. If
granted, the individual would have Participant status for two years from
the date he or she leaves an SDSS institution. At the end of the
two-year period, depending on the individual's continuing contributions
to the survey, he or she may request a two-year extension or permanent
Participant status, again following the procedures outlined above.</p>

<p>Graduate students who have made significant contributions to the
SDSS, according to the criteria above, may also be granted Participant
status upon their graduation. In these cases, the procedures outlined
above for non-tenured scientists should be followed.</p>
