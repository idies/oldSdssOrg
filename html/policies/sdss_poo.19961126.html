<h2>Introductory Background</h2>

<p>The initial Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Principles of Operation
(PoO) were drafted during 1989 and approved by the Astrophysical
Research Consortium (ARC) Board of Governors in February 1990.  The
document served the intended purpose very well for a few years.
However, the passage of time brought circumstances and events which were
not anticipated in the 1990 document. Notable among these was the
addition of four more Participating Institutions: Johns Hopkins
University and University of Washington joined the original ARC members
University of Chicago, Princeton University, and the Institute for
Advanced Study; the Japan Promotional Group and the US Naval Observatory
joined Fermilab as non-ARC participants under Memoranda of
Understanding. By 1995, there was consensus among ARC Board members and
representatives of SDSS Participating Institutions that the PoO should
be updated in combination with a change in the model through which the
ARC Board managed the SDSS project.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at its November 20, 1995 meeting, the ARC Board
adopted a resolution to dissolve the SDSS Subcommittee of the Board
as of December 31, 1995 and establish in its place, effective
January 1, 1996, a new SDSS Advisory Council.  The resolution
charged the SDSS Director and new Advisory Council to review and
update the PoO in 1996 for approval by the Board.  This is the
updated PoO approved by the ARC Board (November 26, 1996).  This
document supersedes the 1990 document, but does not invalidate any
actions taken under the 1990 document.</p>

<h2><a name="secI"></a>I) PREAMBLE</h2>

<ol type="A">

<li><a name="secI.A"></a><p>The goal of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) is to build and operate a dedicated telescope suitable for
wide-angle surveys of the sky which will address critical issues in
extragalactic astronomy, especially in the field of large-scale
structure.  Specifically, a digitized multiband photometric survey at
high northern galactic latitudes (b > 30 degrees) will be conducted, and
in the same area a multifiber spectroscopic survey of galaxies and
quasars will be performed.  This will be supplemented by a deeper survey
with more restricted sky coverage in the southern galactic
hemisphere. Finally, as time and resources allow, the photometric survey
will be extended to cover the remainder of the available sky.  The
photometric survey will serve both to select the galaxies and quasars
for the spectroscopic survey, and as an archival data base in its own
right.  The spectroscopic survey will be primarily designed to yield
accurate redshifts.  The primary survey is expected to take five years
to complete, after a suitable commissioning phase.
</p>

<li><a name="secI.B"></a><p>The top priority will be to ensure that the
scientific integrity of the primary surveys is the highest possible:
calibrations must be extensive and trustworthy.  Moreover, the intent is
that the survey be well enough designed and the data of sufficient
quality so that it will have a long and productive lifetime.</p>

<li><a name="secI.C"></a><p>There will be two main products of this
survey which constitute the core of the project: the Archive, a reliable
and easily utilized data base which will be made available to the
public, and the Scientific Analyses of the data in the Archive which
will provide insight into the nature and origin of large-scale structure
and achieve other important scientific goals.</p>

<p>Using the Archive constructed by the SDSS project, and provided to
the Participants, the Participants may carry out whatever scientific
projects they choose, subject to the policy guidelines discussed in <a
href="#secIV">Section IV</a> and <a href="#secV">Section V</a>. They
must provide their own funding for needed resources, above and beyond
the Archive and the software tools provided by the project as part of
the Archive.</p>

<p>Consistent with plans to maintain the integrity and usability of the
Archive, the Participating Institutions intend to release the first two
years of survey data at a time prior to final completion of the survey,
in order to provide a "preview" of the full survey.</p>

<p>Work aimed at extracting intermediate scientific results as the
survey progresses will be encouraged. However, Participants engaged in
this work must provide their own extra resources as needed and help in
the overall quality control effort (indeed, such work is an essential
part of this effort).</p>

<p>The intent is to make data public within two years of the completion
of the survey. Details of the data and publication policy for
Participants and their collaborators are presented in <a
href="#secIV">Section IV</a>.</p>

<li><a name="secI.D"></a><p>In addition to the primary surveys and the
photometric survey of the available Galactic disk, Initiatives for
other, separately funded projects to use available telescope time or the
Archive in new ways will be entertained provided that they do not
interfere with or significantly delay the primary surveys.  These may
include spectroscopic work in the Galactic plane or analyses of archived
data which are scientifically distinct from the core program.</p>

<li><a name="secI.E"></a><p>This document presents the Principles of
Operation (PoO) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they have been
agreed upon by the Participating Institutions. They may be revised as
needed by future agreements.</p>

</ol>


<h2><a name="secII"></a>II) MANAGEMENT</h2>

<ol type="A">

<h3><a name="secII.A"></a><li>Board</h3> 

<p>Ultimate responsibility for all aspects of the SDSS project,
including approval of annual budgets and requests for outside funding
for the SDSS project, rests with the Board. The Board is assisted by the
Advisory Council on matters concerning the SDSS project. The Board must
approve entry of all Participating Institutions into the SDSS project;
one criterion for entry will be the written acceptance of these
PoO. Changes to the PoO must be approved by the Board and will generally
be based on recommendations from the Advisory Council, acting either at
its own initiative or in response to a request from the Board.
</p>

<h3><a name="secII.B"></a><li>Advisory Council</h3>

<p>In addition to advising the Board on matters relating to the SDSS
project, members of the Advisory Council represent the Participating
Institutions and are therefore the primary channel through which
information flows between the Board on the one hand, and the
Participants and Participating Institutions on the other.</p>

<p>The Advisory Council will be appointed by the Board from among
nominations by the Participating Institutions.  Each Participating
Institution will be represented by at least one and not more than two
members.  The Chair of the Board will be an <em>ex officio</em> member
of the Advisory Council.  The Chair of the Advisory Council will be
appointed by the Board for a specified term.</p>

<p>The Advisory Council will meet as deemed necessary, but generally at
least three times per year.  Meetings may be conducted in-person or via
teleconferencing.  Meeting dates will be set and announced well in
advance to assure good attendance.  The agenda will be distributed at
least five (5) days in advance of the meeting to Advisory Council
members plus the Chair and Secretary of the Board, and the Chair of the
SAC.  The Advisory Council Chair is responsible for timely filing of
approved meeting minutes with the ARC Secretary.</p>

<p>The Advisory Council will identify and evaluate candidates for the
position of Director when the incumbent's term is coming to an end, or
when the position is vacated unexpectedly.  The Director will be
appointed by the Board taking into consideration the recommendation of
the Advisory Council.</p>

<h3><a name="secII.C"></a><li>Director</h3>

<p>The Board has delegated to the Director the executive authority for
construction of the telescope and related hardware and software, and for
operation of the survey.  To those ends, the Director is responsible
for:
<ul>
<li>selecting key personnel; 

<li>keeping the Advisory Council informed on the status of the project,
including any major problems and plans for resolving them;

<li>working with ARC officers in conducting the project so as to comply
with the terms of funding awards received by ARC from federal agencies
and private entities;

<li>drafting for concurrence by the Advisory Council
and approval by the Board the Memorandum of Understanding with any
non-ARC member Participating Institution.
</ul></p>

<p>The Director will submit annual budgets to the Advisory Council.
These budgets will include funds and in-kind services needed for planned
construction, maintenance, and use of the SDSS telescope, instruments,
and Archive.  The Advisory Council will transmit the Director's budget
along with its recommendations to the Board for approval.</p>

<p>The Director will provide financial summaries to the Advisory Council
monthly to show expenditures and obligations compared to the major line
item budget.  The Director will be assisted in preparing annual budgets
and monthly financial summaries by the ARC corporate office under the
general supervision of the ARC Treasurer.</p>

<h3><a name="secII.D"></a><li>Science Advisory Committee (SAC)</h3>

<p>The Director appoints the Science Advisory Committee (SAC) Chair for
a fixed term after consultation with representatives of the
Participating Institutions.  Other members of the SAC are appointed by
the Director for a fixed term in consultation with the SAC Chair.  These
SAC members include one representative from each of the Working Groups,
plus others at the Director's discretion.  In consultation with the
Director, the SAC Chair may appoint <em>ad hoc</em> groups to assist
with specific science issues or scientific tasks.</p>

<p>The SAC's advisory responsibility embraces the broad spectrum of
science issues inherent in successful implementation and conduct of the
SDSS project.  These include, but are not limited to, policies
concerning instrumentation, survey strategy, telescope scheduling,
access to science data, and publication.  The SAC reviews Proposals and
Initiatives and reports their recommendations to the Director.  These
responsibilities are described more fully in <a href="#secV">Section
V</a>.</p>

<p>Informal communication among members of the SAC, Board, and Advisory
Council is encouraged.  Any formal Board or Advisory Council
communications with the SAC is through the Director.  These
communications may include inviting the SAC Chair and/or other SAC
members to participate in meetings of the Board or the Advisory
Council.</p>


<h3><a name="secII.E"></a><li>Working Groups (WG)</h3>

<p>WGs of the SDSS project have been formed to address the following
specific topics: large scale structure, clusters, galaxies, quasars,
stars, serendipity, southern survey, reddening, and solar system. The
function of these groups is to consider the complete flow of the data
relevant to each WG from the CCD's through to the final publication of
data and analysis. The WGs will define requirements for equipment,
observing time, analysis software, and archiving.  These specifications
will be considered by the SAC in formulating recommendations to the
Director in the same categories.</p>

<p>A representative (who may or may not be the Chair) of each WG will be
appointed to the SAC by the Director in consultation with the SAC Chair.
The Director appoints Chairs of existing WGs.  The appointment of each
WG Chair will be for a fixed term.</p>

<p>New WGs may be formed and existing WGs may be disbanded by the
submission of a written plan to the SAC Chair.  The SAC must concur
before further action is taken.  Where the plan calls for a new WG, it
may be implemented when the SAC has concurred and the Advisory Council
has approved the Director's recommendation for the WG Chair.  Where the
plan calls for disbanding an existing WG, concurrence by the SAC is the
final action.</p>

<p>It is imperative that the Advisory Council be fully informed on SDSS
science issues.  Accordingly, Advisory Council meeting agendas will
frequently include reports on these issues by the Director and the SAC
Chair.</p>
</ol>

<h2><a name="secIII"></a>III) SCIENTIFIC GOALS</h2>

<ol type="A">

<h3><a name="secIII.A"></a><li>Primary Surveys</h3>

    <ol type="i">
    <li><p>In the pi steradians of the North Galactic Pole region
    (defined approximately by b>30 deg) we shall conduct surveys in the
    following manner:

	<ol type="a">
	<li>Obtain a photometric survey in five filters to 23rd
	magnitude (r', five sigma) for stellar objects;

	<li>Obtain redshifts for all galaxies brighter than r'=18.

	<li>Obtain redshifts for all quasars brighter than r'=19
	identifiable by photometric indices.

	<li>Obtain spectra of a limited number of other targets of high
	scientific importance, as defined by the SAC.
	</ol>

    <p>The velocity precision for galaxies should in all cases be
    limited by photon noise and should be better than 60 km/s for normal
    galaxies at the survey limit.  The data should be archived as a full
    data set of all pixels on the sky as well as in reduced data sets
    for later analysis and distribution.  Such reduced data sets include
    atlas images of all detected objects, catalogs of image parameters
    for all detected objects, and one-dimensional spectra and catalogs
    of redshifts and spectral properties of all objects for which
    spectra have been obtained.</p>

    <li><p>In the available South Galactic Pole region there will be a
    deeper survey in a strip 2.5 degrees wide and approximately 90
    degrees long, in order to:

	<ol type="a">
	<li>Obtain a photometric survey in five filters to about 25th
	magnitude (r', 5 sigma) for stellar objects by coaddition of
	repeated images;

	<li>Investigate motion and variability in that region over the
	duration of the survey, as derived from the scans obtained for
	A.ii.a above;

	<li>Obtain spectra for all objects to suitably defined limits
	somewhat fainter than defined in i.b and i.c above in some
	substantial fraction of the survey area, and

	<li>Conduct other spectroscopic investigations as are deemed
	appropriate to explore the spectroscopic selection criteria used
	in the Northern Survey.
	</ol></p>

    <li><p>In the additional available sky covering the Galactic disk, a
    deep photometric survey will be conducted on a best-effort basis to
    obtain a deep imaging survey to the same sensitivity as the Northern
    survey.
    </ol>

<p>Prioritization of resources - financial, human, and telescope
availability - is indicated by the ordering (i), (ii), (iii) above.  The
jointly raised funds will be dedicated to these projects.  Completion of
project (iii) may require additional time and funding.

<h3><a name="secIII.B"></a><li>Additional Projects</h3>

    <ol type="i">
    <li>Spectroscopic study of objects in the Galactic disk or of
    objects in the North Galactic Pole region not studied in <a
    href="#secIII.A">(A.i.b), (A.i.c) or (A.i.d)</a> above, performed on
    a basis which is strictly non-interfering with the primary surveys.

    <li>Analysis of archived data from <a href="#secIII.A">(A.i),
    (A.ii), or (A.iii)</a> above for scientific purposes distinct from
    the core scientific program (A) outlined above (cf. <a
    href="#secI.D">Section I.D</a>).
    </ol>

</ol>


<h2><a name="secIV"></a>IV) DATA AND PUBLICATION POLICIES</h2>

<ol type="A">

<h3><a name="secIV.A"></a><li>Participants</h3>

    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Participants have access to all the primary and reduced data
    from the primary surveys ("core survey data"). Participants must
    read and abide by the PoO, and are responsible for protecting the
    scientific integrity of the SDSS and the data rights of other
    Participants.</p>

    <p>At the ARC Participating Institutions, Participants are defined
    to be the full-time PhD-level scientific staff (receive at least 50%
    of their annual salary from that institution). They must also either
    have Principal Investigator status at that institution, or be
    primarily employed to work on the SDSS, or have performed the
    equivalent of two years service to the SDSS (as judged by the
    SAC).</p>

    <p>Participants at the other Participating Institutions are defined
    via the individual MOU's.</p>

    <p>The SAC may also designate other scientists as Participants.</p>

    <li><p>It is anticipated that the scientific results of the core
    surveys will be published primarily and jointly by the Participants
    belonging to the WGs, with other Participants added by mutual
    agreement.
    </ol>

<h3><a name="secIV.B"></a><li>Projects and Publications</h3>

    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Participants must notify each other on initiation of any
    scientific project utilizing primary survey data that is expected
    ultimately to result in a publication. Electronic mail is suitable,
    and the SAC will maintain an accessible file ("project list"), which
    lists, for each project, the subject matter, known collaborators, a
    contact person (with address), and the desired date for completion
    of the project and submission of a manuscript for publication.</p>
    
    <li><p>At least one month before submission of any manuscript for
    publication which utilizes core survey data, the submission plan
    must be publicized to all Participants by electronic mail, with
    paper title, authors, and journal of submission added to an
    accessible file, kept by the SAC, entitled the "publication list".
    By "publication", we signify submission either to a scientific
    journal or to any other public forum.</p>
    </ol>

<h3><a name="secIV.C"></a><li>Authorship</h3>

    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>Any Participant, at any stage, of a research project may
    request that his/her name be added to the list of authors, with the
    presumption that permission will be granted if there has been any
    significant contribution to the project or to the SDSS
    infrastructure.</p>

    <li><p>If there are disputes among Participants on authorship, the
    SAC will recommend a solution of these to the Director, who will
    rule on individual cases. In the unlikely event of protest of such
    rulings, the issue may be appealed to the Advisory Council.  It will
    have jurisdiction on the basis of a majority vote.</p>
    </ol>

<h3><a name="secIV.D"></a><li>Protection of Survey Scientific
Integrity</h3>

    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>If any project is added to the publication list without due
    notice on the project list, the Director may rule for a delay in
    publication on the advice of the SAC with the same rights of appeal
    (cf. <a href="#secIV.C">IV C.2</a>).</p>

    <li><p>If any project is added to the publication list which the
    Director, on the basis of advice from the SAC, deems not technically
    ready for publication, the Director may rule for delay, with the
    same right of appeal.</p>

    <li><p>Any Participant who submits for publication results based on
    core survey data without notifying colleague Participants by listing
    the project in the publication list and any Participant violating
    rulings of the Director on the above noted matters, may be barred
    from further access to the Survey data by the Director, on advice of
    the SAC, with the same right of appeal.</p>
    </ol>

<h3><a name="secIV.E"></a><li>Further Guidelines</h3>

<p>The SAC may develope more detailed guidelines concerning the above,
as they deem appropriate. A copy of these guidelines would be available
from the Chair of the SAC, and should be read and agreed to by
Participants and Participating Institutions.
</ol>


<h2><a name="secV"></a>V) PROPOSALS AND INITIATIVES</h2>

<ol type="A">

<h3><a name="secV.A"></a><li>Proposals to Construct or Operate the
SDSS</h3>

<p>Proposals submitted by ARC as-a-whole to Federal or philanthropic
sources to secure the funds to support the construction and operation of
the SDSS require approval by the ARC Board of Governors following a
recommendation by the Advisory Council.  Such Proposals take precedence
over other SDSS-related Proposals by Participants, and the Board may
take appropriate steps to protect them, with proper notification to the
Participants.</p>

<h3><a name="secV.B"></a><li>Proposals to Fund Scientific Research</h3>

<p>During the period prior to the first significant public release of
SDSS data, a set of policies, procedures, and guidelines will apply to
applications by Participants that seek substantial (more than $30K
total) funding from US Federal sources for the primary purpose of
supporting research using SDSS data. The purposes of such strictures are
to protect the scientific integrity of the SDSS; to foster equity and
collegiality within the collaboration; to present an organized, rational
funding plan to financial sponsors and the scientific community; to
insure that the SDSS data are described in a technically-responsible
manner; and to insure that the Proposals do not contain items or
describe arrangements that conflict with the PoO, the MOUs, or the
agreements already in place with major SDSS funding sources.</p>

<p>Except as specifically noted below, approaches to philanthropic or
state sources are not subject to these strictures.  Participating
Institutions should keep one another informed about such activity on a
best-effort basis through their members on the Advisory Council and ARC
Board.</p>

<p>Proposals will fall into two categories: Key Projects and everything
else.</p>

    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>It is the responsibility of each Working Group (WG) to define
    a set of Key Projects that constitute the core science of that
    WG.</p>

    <li><p>The WGs will determine the science team members and leaders
    for these projects.</p>

    <li><p>The specific criteria and procedures used by a WG to select
    Key Projects, team members, and leaders will be developed by that
    WG.  However, these criteria should be based primarily on maximizing
    the scientific return. Due recognition should also be given to those
    who have made major contributions to the SDSS, and the balance
    between the junior and senior members of the WG should be equitably
    reflected.</p>

    <li><p>The SAC will collect and organize these projects. The SAC
    Chair in consultation with SAC members will insure that the
    guidelines described above have been followed and will adjudicate
    disputes.  If the SAC judges that a WG has not developed an adequate
    set of Key Projects, the SAC may augment the list of projects and
    solicit interest from the Participants in the formation of the
    additional teams.</p>

    <li><p>The SAC Chair will forward the recommended set of Key Project
    abstracts, team members, and team leaders to the Director for
    approval. The Director will address any institutional issues that
    may arise, such as adequate representation of the ARC and MOU
    Participating Institutions.</p>

    <li><p>These Key Project teams will respond to funding opportunities
    by developing and submitting Proposals.  The PI on such a Key
    Project Proposal need not be the team leader (e.g. as in the case of
    a team headed by a member of the JPG), but his/her institution will
    assume primary administrative responsibility. These proposals will
    be vetted by the SAC prior to submission, following which the
    Director may formally endorse such Proposals as representing the
    considered and coordinated effort of the SDSS team in that key area
    of research.</p>

    <li><p>It is the responsibility of a PI or team leader to inform the
    relevant WG Chair as to the status of their Proposal.  In the event
    that a Proposal for a Key Project is declined by the funding agency,
    the WG may choose to significantly modify the scientific content and
    team membership (in a manner consistent with the above).  Such
    changes would be reviewed by the SAC and their recommendations sent
    to the Director for approval.</p>

    <li><p>The intention to submit a Proposal (whether or not it is a
    Key Project) shall be announced by the PI to the Participants in the
    form of a publically-posted title, brief research summary, list of
    team members, and estimated total budget at least one month prior to
    Proposal submission.  The SAC will maintain an accessible file
    ("proposal list") for this purpose. The project would appreciate a
    posting of the disposition of the Proposal when that is
    determined.</p>

    <li><p>Following the first public release of a significant amount of
    SDSS data (a milestone to be defined by the SAC), the above policies
    and procedures become null and void.</p>

    <li><p>Proposing institutions are responsible for all incremental
    costs deriving from the proposed research.</p>

    <li><p>All Proposals by individuals or teams for support for SDSS
    science (whether or not they fall in the realm of Key Projects, and
    whether they are to federal, state, or philanthropic sources) shall
    be carefully vetted by the PI's institution to insure that they do
    not contain items or describe arrangements that conflict with the
    PoO, the MOUs, or the agreements already in place with major SDSS
    funding sources. The Director will develop a summary of such
    sensitive issues and distribute it to the relevant parties at the
    Participating Institutions. More generally, it is the responsibility
    of the members of the Advisory Council to insure that Participants
    and the relevant institutional officers (e.g.  Departmental Chair,
    Director of Sponsored Programs, etc.) are informed of the above
    procedures, as is implied by that institution's acceptance of the
    PoO.</p>

    <li><p>Persons blatantly violating these policies may have their
    status as a Participant revoked on the basis of a majority vote by
    the Advisory Council following the recommendation of the
    Director.</p>
    </ol>

<h3><a name="secV.C"></a><li>Extension Beyond the Core Program</h3>

<p>Initiatives to use or augment the SDSS hardware, and/or data archive,
and/or operations for purposes that are not part of the core program
will be reviewed by the SAC on the basis of their scientific merit and
by the Director to insure their technical appropriateness and assess
their financial impact.  The proponents will be responsible for any
resulting incremental costs.</p>

<p>The Director will prepare a recommendation to the Advisory Council,
which will determine the extent of any required modification of the PoO.
The Chair of the Advisory Council will transmit the Initiative, the
Director's recommendation, and the Advisory Council's own
recommendations to the Board.  Approval of the Initiative may be granted
contingent upon the proponents securing the necessary financial
resources.</p>

<h3><a name="secV.D"></a><li>Early Collaborative Use of the Data Archive
by Non-Participants</h3>

<p>Prior to the public release of the data archive or the publication of
the relevant portions thereof, non-Participants may request to conduct
research with, or otherwise make use of, limited portions of the SDSS
data archive in collaboration with Participants.  Such Initiatives may
involve the provision of support, resources, observational or
computational facilities, or expertise by the collaborating
non-Participants. The proponents will be entirely responsible for any
associated incremental costs.  The collaborating Participants will be
responsible for protecting the scientific integrity of the SDSS and the
data rights of other Participants.</p>

<p> These Initiatives will be reviewed by the SAC and then by the
Director. A subsequent review by the Advisory Council and approval by
the Board is required if the Director finds the Initiative meritorious,
but determines that there may be a financial impact on the Participating
Institutions or a potential conflict with the existing institutional
arrangements.</p>

<h3><a name="secV.E"></a><li>Use of Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>Initiatives to use the intellectual property of the SDSS
collaboration will be covered by the Intellectual Property Policy of
ARC, Inc., a copy of which is available from the ARC Corporate
Secretary.</p>

</ol>


<h2><a name="secVI"></a>VI) RELATIONSHIP TO NON-PARTICIPATING ARC
INSTITUTIONS</h2>

<p>The SDSS was undertaken on the premise that all ARC scientists
would enjoy direct and indirect benefits from it. Major scientific
and financial benefits include:</p>

    <ol type="A">
    <li><p>All ARC scientists may submit Initiatives to the SAC
    involving either limited early access to portions of the Archive (<a
    href="#secV.D">Section V.D</a>), or the extension of the SDSS beyond
    the core surveys (<a href="#secV.C">Section V.C</a>). Evaluation
    will be based primarily on scientific merit and technical
    appropriateness, and secondarily on institutional affiliation. One
    member from a non-Participating ARC institution will be invited by
    the Director to be present when the SAC evaluates such
    Initiatives.</p>

    <li><p>The SDSS facilities will operate on ARC's Apache Point site
    and share operations staff with the 3.5m telescope, affording both
    projects the benefits of a broader skill mix. Staff and other common
    operations support costs will be apportioned between the projects by
    mutual agreement of the directors.</p>

    <li><p>Results from SDSS site monitoring equipment will be made
    available to users of the 3.5m telescope.</p>

    <li><p>The SDSS project has repaid the 3.5m telescope project a
    prorata share of the initial site infrastructure costs, under a
    rationale approved by the Board.</p>

    <li><p>When the SDSS project is completed, operation and/or
    disposition of SDSS facilities will be determined by the Board.</p>
    </ol>
