<h2><a name="sec1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
</p>

<p>This document describes the policies and guidelines governing the
publication of scientific and technical results from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (hereafter SDSS).  The SDSS Publication Policy is designed to
promote the scientific and technical accuracy of SDSS publications and
ensure that fair credit is given to the authors and to other individuals
who have contributed to the SDSS.  In addition, SDSS participants should
be encouraged to carry out excellent science with the database and to
publish their results in a timely manner.  By agreeing collectively on
how publication issues will be handled, we aim to minimize future
disagreement among SDSS participants.  Unless explicitly stated
otherwise, this document applies to publications based on data taken
with the SDSS telescopes which are not yet in the public domain,
including both the Northern and the Southern survey data, as well as
data taken with the survey equipment during or before the test year.
</p>

<p>This policy applies to: papers submitted to electronic archives and
refereed journals; scientific or technical books or book sections about
the SDSS and its results; graphical or tabular materials or discussions
of results, in electronic or hard-copy form, that are based on analysis
of unreleased SDSS data and are generally accessible to non-SDSS
participants (e.g., via a public WWW site or a publicly distributed
preprint).  The special cases of conference presentations, conference
proceedings papers, and theses are discussed in <a href="#sec8">Section
8</a>.  Communications which are not directly covered by this document,
but the dissemination of which should be consistent with it, include:
popular articles and books, circulars, telegrams, electronic
announcements, press releases, and press conferences.
</p>

<p>Responsibility for oversight of SDSS publications rests with the SDSS
Project Spokesperson.  The SDSS Collaboration Council (hereafter CoCo),
which serves as an advisory body to the Spokesperson, has been charged
with formulating this Publication policy and ensuring that it is
efficiently implemented to the benefit of the collaboration.  Each SDSS
Participating Institution (including the 5 participating ARC
institutions and the non-ARC institutions participating through MOUs) is
represented on the Collaboration Council; in addition, there is one
representative for those SDSS participants not at participating
institutions.
</p>

<p>As the Survey progresses, the Spokesperson may revise this
Publication Policy from time to time in what he or she perceives to be
the best interests of (and in consultation with) the collaboration.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec2"></a>2. Types of Papers</h2>

<p>We distinguish two types of publication, "scientific papers" and
"technical papers."  Scientific papers are based on analyses of, or
presentations of, the SDSS data.  Technical papers describe the SDSS
instrumentation, calibration, software, strategy, and targeting
algorithms.  Technical papers may include some SDSS data for
illustrative purposes.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec3"></a>3. Publication Coordinators</h2>

<p>Logistical responsibility for handling scientific and technical
papers will rest with the Scientific and the Technical Publications
Coordinators (hereafter SPC and TPC), respectively.  Unresolved disputes
about publication matters will be settled by an Ombudsperson.  The SPC,
TPC, and Ombudsperson are appointed by the SDSS Management Committee.
</p>

<p>The Publications Coordinators will ensure that publications follow
the publication process outlined in <a href="#sec8">Section 8</a>
below. To aid in this process, they will maintain a common electronic
WWW-based archive of all scientific and technical publications of the
SDSS, hereafter the Publications Archive, with accompanying graphical
and tabular material, which shall be accessible to the participants
only.  The Publications Archive will contain several kinds of entries:
<ol type="i">
<li>projects under investigation or in preparation</li>
<li>papers available for review by the collaboration</li>
<li>papers approved for public distribution and journal submission</li>
<li>other SDSS documents of general interest, such as related papers by
SDSS participants not based upon SDSS data, common proposals (e.g., <a
href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/PBOOK/welcome.htm">the SDSS Project
Book</a>), etc.</li>
<li>the SDSS acknowledgement script required on publications
(<a href="#sec8.5">Sec. 8.5</a>)</li>
<li>the current list of SDSS builders and participants (Sects. <a
href="#sec4">4</a>,<a href="#sec5">5</a>)</li>
<li>the current version of this Publication Policy.</li>
</ol>
The papers in this archive that have been approved for distribution may
be used by any SDSS participant for purposes of public presentation,
review articles, etc.
</p>

<p>The TPC will maintain a complete list of technical publications
describing the hardware, software, etc on the Publications Archive.  All
SDSS scientific papers should reference the appropriate technical
papers.  The TPC will help coordinate publication of these technical
papers to ensure that technical documentation of the project is
disseminated efficiently and promptly.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec4"></a>4. Participants</h2>

<p>Participants are defined by <a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.1">Sec.4.1
of the PoO</a>.  An updated list of participants shall be maintained by
the Spokesperson, with input from the participating institutions. All
participants must read and agree to the contents of this document before
accessing the SDSS data.  All participants must follow the rules of
authorship and publication described in this document.  Those who
violate these rules are subject to losing their participant status, by
the procedures set out in the PoO.
</p>

<p>The Spokesperson will keep the list of participants up-to-date and
posted on the Publication Archive.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec4.1"></a>4.1 Non-Participants</h3>

<p>According to <a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.2">Sec.4.2 of the PoO</a>,
non-Participants may request access to limited portions of the SDSS data
archive for work in collaboration with Participants.  Such requests will
be decided by the Management Committee.  Once granted limited data
access, non-participants must read and agree to the contents of this
document and follow the rules described herein.  Non-participants
violating these rules are subject to losing their data access.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec5"></a>5. Builders</h2>

<p>In order to ensure that proper credit is given to those who were
responsible for the construction and maintenance of the hardware,
software, and other infrastructure of the SDSS, a list of "builders"
will be maintained by the Spokesperson and posted on the Publication
Archive.  Each builder will have the automatic right to co-authorship on
every SDSS scientific paper.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec5.1"></a>5.1 Construction of the builder list</h3>

<p>Builders are those who have made substantial contributions to the
SDSS hardware and software as a whole, including (but not limited to)
the areas of optics, telescope, infrastructure, calibration, camera,
spectrographs, data reduction and archiving software, commissioning,
management, and major fundraising.  The definition of "substantial
contribution" is work equivalent to two years at full time.
</p>

<p>Since the major SDSS components have been the responsibility of
individual SDSS institutions, each institution, through its
Collaboration Council representative, shall put together a list of the
persons considered to be qualified, including those who have moved to
other institutions, along with a brief summary of the contribution of
each individual to the project. The justification for each individual's
inclusion in the lists should be spelled out specifically as a
description of her or his direct contribution.  Being on the SDSS
payroll or being a member of a Working Group for the appropriate length
of time does not by itself provide sufficient justification.
</p>

<p>The Collaboration Council shall concatenate the individual
institution lists, add those who have earned builder status at non-SDSS
institutions, and forward the combined list to the Spokesperson for
approval by the SDSS Management Committee (MC). It is anticipated that
approval by the MC will in most cases be pro forma.  However, the MC
will remove suggested names if those persons do not meet the criteria
described above, and may request documentation and justification for
possibly deserving persons who are not on the lists. It may also
request additional information for those on the lists where
clarification is needed. The Chair of the Management Committee will
notify builders of their selection.
</p>

<p>The Spokesperson will keep the builder list up-to-date and posted
on the Publication Archive.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec5.2"></a>5.2 Addition of builders</h3>

<p>Some individuals have performed exceptional service to the SDSS
without fulfilling the above criteria, and may be proposed by their
institutions as additional builders.  Others may in the future make
substantial contributions which meet the above criteria and can be
proposed on a case by case basis.
</p>

<p>Some individuals may not be included on the list generated by their
institution, but may feel that they merit inclusion.  Such individuals
should request inclusion from their institution.  If their request is
denied, they may state their case in writing to the Management
Committee, whose decision will be final.
</p>

<h3><a name="sec5.3"></a>5.3 Removal of builders</h3>

<p>Since individuals become members of the above lists by dint of work
already performed, they cannot be removed unless they explicitly request
removal.  Builders remain on the builder list even when they leave an
SDSS institution, and even in the unlikely event that they commit
sufficient infractions to have their data rights revoked.</p>


<h2><a name="sec6"></a>6. Key Projects</h2>

<p>The science projects deemed central to the SDSS are the Key Projects.
Key Projects are organized by the Working Groups (WGs).  The
responsibilities of the WGs, WG chairs, and Key Project teams are
spelled out in the revised PoO.  In February of 1997, the SAC produced a
<a href="../collaboration/key_projects.html">Key Project list</a> upon
the recommendation of the WGs.  The Spokesperson will maintain this list
and keep it up-to-date and posted on the Publication Archive.
</p>

<p>As the Key Project papers are the primary scientific legacy of the
SDSS, the collaboration has a vested interest in ensuring that they are
of the highest quality.  The respective WGs are encouraged to review
these papers to ensure this.  Given their importance, the collective
scrutiny they are expected to undergo, and to encourage participants to
work on these projects within the Working Groups, these papers will
carry the phrase "for the SDSS Collaboration" following the author list.
</p>


<h2><a name="sec7"></a>7. Authorship</h2>

<h3><a name="sec7.1"></a>7.1 Scientific papers</h3>

<h4><a name="sec7.1.1"></a>7.1.1 Author inclusion</h4>

<p>At the very least, any scientific paper will include in its author
list any individual who has contributed to the scientific analyses
presented, along with all builders who have requested authorship.  In
addition, <a href="sdss_poo.html#sec4.4.1">Sec.4.4.1</a> of the PoO
states that "any Participant, at any stage of a research project, may
request that his/her name be added to the list of authors, with the
presumption that permission will be granted if there has been any
significant contribution to that research project."  With the exception
of builders, those requesting co-authorship should include a brief
description of their contributions to the project. Authorship requests
should be made to the paper's team contact (see <a
href="#sec8.1">Sec. 8.1</a>). Project teams are expected to err on the
side of inclusion in response to such requests.
</p>

<p>Anyone who has been placed on a paper's author list may make a
request to the paper's team contact at any time that her or his name be
removed from the paper and it shall be removed.
</p>

<p>During the three-week period that the paper is available to the
collaboration (see <a href="#sec8.1">Sec. 8.1</a>), the SPC will check
that the author list on each scientific paper is appropriate and that
the appropriate technical papers are cited.  Disputes about author
inclusion will be settled by the Ombudsperson, whose decisions will be
final.
</p>

<h4><a name="sec7.1.2"></a>7.1.2 Two-group author order</h4>

<p>The scientific achievements of the SDSS will truly be collaboration
achievements, because the SDSS hardware and software make possible
projects that would in many cases be inconceivable without them (or
without some similarly ambitious undertaking).  However, an authorship
policy that strictly recognizes all scientific papers purely as products
of the collaboration (e.g., alphabetical authorship on all papers) runs
the risk of making the individuals in the project effectively anonymous,
and it provides little incentive for project participants to analyze the
data quickly rather than wait for data to become public.  Therefore, for
most SDSS scientific publications (with the exceptions discussed below),
the order of authorship will follow a "two-group" system.  The first
group of authors, the "analysis group", will consist of those who were
heavily involved in the specific analysis described in the paper and in
the writing of the paper. The other group will consist of all other
authors on the paper and will be ordered alphabetically after the
analysis group authors.
</p>

<p>Membership in the analysis group and order of authorship within the
analysis group should be decided by those involved in writing the paper,
just as they would decide on membership and order in the author list if
they were writing a non-SDSS science paper.  Analysis group membership
should be restricted to those who have played major roles in the
analysis for and writing of the paper, so it will rarely exceed a
handful of authors.  In the event of a disagreement about membership in
the analysis group or order of authorship, the authors may present their
cases to the Ombudsperson, whose decisions will be final.
</p>

<p>The analysis group is always permitted to join the two author groups
and make their author order strictly alphabetical.
</p>


<h4><a name="sec7.1.3"></a>7.1.3 Data-release publications</h4>
   
<p>The only scientific publications which must have a strictly
alphabetical list of authors are data-release publications, which
present the public domain catalogs for access by the astronomical
community.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec7.2"></a>7.2 Technical papers</h3>

<p>Those who have worked on a particular component or subsystem will
author the appropriate technical paper, with author order decided by
the authors.  Disputes may be taken to the Ombudsperson, whose
decisions will be final.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec7.3"></a>7.3 Conference proceedings</h3>

<p>Because of the practical constraints of page limits, submissions to
conference proceedings are not required to follow the authorship policy
above.  However, any conference paper that does not follow this
authorship policy may only include quantitative results (tables and
figures, for example) based on papers that have been published or
submitted for publication, and it must reference those papers as the
primary source for the results.  The rationale for this requirement is
that conference papers authored by a single author or a small group
should not become the primary reference for results that are properly
products of the SDSS Collaboration.  Conference proceedings which are
primarily overviews of the SDSS project status or scientific results
should include the byline "for the SDSS Collaboration" after the list of
authors.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec7.4">7.4 Theses</h3>

<p>By necessity, whether they would otherwise qualify as scientific or
technical papers, undergraduate or graduate theses will be authored by a
single author. However, it is required that the author will acknowledge
the contribution of the SDSS collaboration and reference the papers
describing the thesis results that have been published in or submitted
to research journals (see <a href="#sec8.3">Sec. 8.3</a>).
</p>


<h2><a name="sec8"></a>8. The Publication Process</h2>

<h3><a name="sec8.1"></a>8.1 Scientific papers</h3>

<p>To ensure that SDSS publications fairly represent the contributions
of those involved in the Survey and that publications are vetted in a
timely and efficient manner, scientific papers based on unreleased
SDSS data will be handled as follows:
</p>

<ol type="i">
<li><p>
When a scientific investigation begins, a project team of SDSS
participants identifies a team contact who shall provide to the SPC a
project title, a list of current project team members, and a brief
abstract of the project.  In the case of Key Projects, the team contact
should also pass this information to the relevant WG chair(s).  The SPC
posts the above information to the Publications Archive under the
heading of "Active Projects".  At this and any other stage of the
process, other SDSS participants can join the project team.
</p></li>

<li><p>When a draft of the scientific paper has been written, the team
contact forwards it to the SPC, who posts it to the Publication Archive
as a "pending" paper and electronically notifies the collaboration
(e.g., via a message to sdss-general). SDSS participants then have
three weeks to make comments, request co-authorship, etc, to the team
contact (with copies sent to the SPC). To streamline the process, an
automated system to query builders or respond positively to their
authorship requests should be used. The team contact is encouraged to
circulate substantive comments received on the paper's content, along
with the team's response.  The team revises the paper in response to
the comments and other requests it deems valid.
</p>

<p>The SPC, or a representative of the SPC, also checks that the
authorship, references, and acknowledgements fairly represent the
contributions made to the publication, in particular checking that the
appropriate SDSS technical publications are referenced.  The SPC
carries out this duty within the same 3 week period.
</p></li>

<li><p>At the end of the 3 week period, the final version of the
paper (if revised) is sent to the SPC, who posts it to the
Publications Archive with the designation "Approved for Submission" and
assigns it an official SDSS preprint number.  From this point forward,
the paper and its results and accompanying material may normally be
submitted for publication, and quoted in public presentations, etc., by
SDSS participants.  However, in exceptional cases, the authors or the
Spokesperson may request that the results in a particular paper not be
made public until a certain date (e.g., that of a press conference or
press release) or until the paper is accepted by a journal or appears
in print.  Such cases are expected to be rare, and permission to do
this must be granted by the Spokesperson.
</p></li>

<li><p>When a project team makes revisions in response to an external
referee report, it should send the final accepted or published version
of the paper to the SPC for posting on the Publications Archive.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In cases of disputes about credit, authorship, or scientific
results, the SPC shall work with the author(s) and SDSS participants
to resolve them.  In cases where a dispute cannot be resolved, the
matter may be appealed to the Ombudsperson, whose decisions will be
final.
</p>


<h3><a name="sec8.2"></a>8.2 Technical papers</h3>

<ol type="i">
<li><p>When a technical paper is drafted, it is sent to the TPC, who
immediately posts it to the Publications Archive under "pending
technical publications" with an identified team contact.  The TPC, or
a representative of the TPC, will check to ensure that the authorship,
references, and acknowledgements fairly represent the contributions
made to the publication.
</p></li>

<li><p>The TPC and SDSS participants will have three weeks to send
comments to/request changes from the lead author.  Copies of
participant comments should also be sent to the TPC.
</p></li>

<li><p>The lead author sends a revised final draft to the TPC for
posting on the Publications Archive under "approved technical
publications" and submits the paper to the appropriate journal and
public electronic archive.  The contents of the paper may thereafter be
quoted in public presentations, etc., by SDSS participants.
</p></li>

<li><p>When a technical paper is revised in response to an external
referee report, the lead author should send the final published version
of the paper to the TPC for posting on the Publication Archive.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The paper will contain the byline "for the SDSS Collaboration". In the 
case of disputes about technical publications which the TPC cannot resolve,
the matter may be appealed to the Ombudsperson, whose decisions will
be final.</p>


<h3><a name="sec8.3"></a>8.3 Theses</h3>

<p>All theses in which SDSS data play an essential role must be
announced to the collaboration when they are begun, just as with other
publications.  It is the responsibility of each SDSS institution to
work out a process for publishing theses which is consistent with both
SDSS and departmental policies.
</p>

<p>Theses based on SDSS data should not be distributed to the public
via the WWW or other electronic archives until either the data on
which it is based are public or journal articles describing its main
results have been published or submitted for publication.  Any such
distribution should note the journal articles describing the results,
so that they can be appropriately cited by others.
</p>

<h3><a name="sec8.4"></a>8.4 Colloquia, conference presentations, and
conference proceedings</h3>

<p>In oral or display presentations, colloquium or conference speakers
and presenters may, upon consultation with the team contact, make use of
unpublished SDSS results (with the exceptions noted in <a
href="#sec8.1">8.1.iii</a> above) and are expected to give appropriate
credit to the SDSS Collaboration and to those involved in producing the
results shown or described. Conference proceedings are required to
follow the publication procedure described in this Section.  In special
cases, given the realities of conference proceedings submission
deadlines, the authors may request from the Spokesperson an exception
from some or all of the publication process requirements. Such requests
should be submitted at least three weeks prior to the submission
deadline.
</p>

<h3><a name="sec8.5"></a>8.5 Standard acknowledgement</h3>

<p>All SDSS papers, both scientific and technical, including conference
proceedings and theses, must contain the standard SDSS acknowledgement,
which is maintained by the Spokesperson and posted on the Publications
Archive.
</p>

<h3><a name="sec8.6"></a>8.6 Dissemination of Time-critical
Information</h3> 

<p>The SDSS will detect time-variable events and/or objects for which
timely dissemination to the broader astronomical community will pay big
scientific dividends. Participants who carry out programs with SDSS
data that detect time-critical events are encouraged to report these to
the collaboration as a whole, and to the broader community through IAU
Circulars and the like. Given the space constraints and expense of IAU
Circulars, the attribution for the report should read "The Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (see http://www.sdss.org/) reports...".  Relevant
finding charts, positions, and photometry drawn from the SDSS data set
can be released.
