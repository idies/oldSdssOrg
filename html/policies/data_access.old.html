<ol type="1">
<li><p>A graduate student at a Sloan Institution may have access to SDSS
data as long as he is a graduate student at a Sloan Institution and
provided that a Participant at their institution sponsors him.  The
Sponsor shall be responsible for the student using the SDSS data
responsibly and abiding by all Collaboration rules.  The Sponsor shall
inform the Spokesperson of his sponsorship of the student, the
termination of the sponsorship when the student leaves or graduates, and
the title and place of publication of the student's thesis if it
involves SDSS data.  The Sponsor may terminate his sponsorship at any
time by informing the Spokesperson.</p></li>

<li><p>A graduate student at a non-Sloan institution working with a
Sloan Participant may obtain access to SDSS data to work on a specific
project with his Participant Ph.D. adviser by requesting permission to
do so from the Collaboration Council.  The Collaboration Council will
judge such requests by the same standards they use for requests for any
non-Participant to work on a specific project and shall make a
recommendation to the Management Council.  The Management Council will
make the final decision and communicate to the student.  If granted,
data access shall be restricted to the specific student for the specific
project.  The Participant sponsor shall inform the Spokesperson of the
title and place of publication of the student's Ph.D. thesis.</p></li>

<li><p>A postdoc at a Sloan Institution who does not have PI status,
or is not employed full time to work on the SDSS, may have access to
SDSS data if more than 50% of his salary is paid by the Institution
and if a Participant at that Institution agrees to sponsor him (see
item 1 for the obligations of sponsorship).</p></li>
