<ol type="1">
<li><p>An undergraduate or graduate student at an SDSS Institution may
have access to SDSS data as long as he or she is a student at an SDSS
Institution and provided that a Participant at the institution sponsors
him or her.  The Sponsor shall be responsible for ensuring the student
uses the SDSS data properly and abides by all Collaboration rules.  The
Sponsor shall inform the Spokesperson of his or her sponsorship of the
student, the termination of the sponsorship when the student leaves or
graduates, and the title and place of publication of the student's
thesis if it involves SDSS data.  The Sponsor may terminate his or her
sponsorship at any time by informing the Spokesperson.</p></li>

<li><p>A postdoc at an SDSS Institution who does not have PI status, or
is not employed full time to work on the SDSS, may have access to SDSS
data if at least 50% of his or her salary is received from the
Institution and if a Participant at that Institution agrees to sponsor
him or her (see item 1 for the obligations of sponsorship).</p></li>

<li><p>An SDSS participant at a non-SDSS institution (hereafter external
participant) may obtain access to SDSS data for up to 2 graduate
students and up to 2 undergraduate students at any one time to work
closely with the external participant on science key to his or her
research.  A reasonable number of additional students may work
informally (i.e., with no authorship rights) with the external
participant on SDSS projects key to his or her research.  In either
case, the procedures set out in item 1 above should be
followed.</p></li>
        
<li><p>An external participant may obtain access to SDSS data for his or
her postdoc(s), or for students beyond the limits set out in item 3
above, to work on a specific project with him or her by requesting
permission to do so from the Collaboration Council.  In general, the
Collaboration Council will judge such requests by the same standards
applied to requests for any non-Participant to work on a specific
project (see the <a href="ext_coll.html">Procedures for Early
Collaborative Use of SDSS Data with Non-Participants</a>).  Such
requests can also be justified on the basis of significant contributions
(typically greater than 0.5 yr FTE) that the student or postdoc makes to
the survey's technical infrastructure, operations, or scientific
infrastructure (i.e., development of common tools useful for scientific
analyses by other SDSS participants for other SDSS science projects).
Requests for External Collaborator status on this basis shall be made to
the Spokesperson, and the decision will be made by the Management
Committee.  Such requests should clearly spell out the planned or
achieved contributions to SDSS infrastructure.  Once approved, a brief
annual progress report must be sent to the Spokesperson detailing the
student's or the postdoc's contributions to SDSS infrastructure.  The
Spokesperson will keep the Collaboration Council informed of such
requests and arrangements.</p></li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These rules apply to access to unpublished
SDSS data only.</p>
