<h1>SDSS Policy for Press Releases
</h1>

1) A proposal for a press release of an SDSS scientific result (and
possibly an associated press conference) may arise from any source.
Often this source is the principal author of a paper recently posted
to the Collaboration.  In the following "principal author" will be
used to designate this lead scientist.  Normally a press release is
timed to coincide with the public release of the paper (e.g. posting
to astro-ph or a talk at a AAS meeting).<br>
<br>

2) The principal author confers with the SDSS Project Spokesperson to
determine that pursuing a press release is appropriate.<br>
<br>

3) If the Spokesperson concurs, the principal author contacts the
Public Information Officer (SDSS PIO) and provides him with the current
version of the paper, a non-technical summary of the key results, and any
graphical or other relevant information.<br>
<br>

4) The first draft of the release is written by the principal author,
with the assistance of the Spokesperson and the PIO.  The PIO of the
principal author's institution is invited to contribute.  The SDSS PIO
ensures inclusion of the standard acknowledgment of sponsoring
institutions and funding agencies.<br>
<br>

5) Comments and corrections to the first draft are requested by the SDSS PIO
of all authors on the paper.  It is the responsibility of the principal
author to ensure that the SDSS PIO has a current list of authors and their
email addresses.<br>
<br>

6) The Spokesperson, aided by the working groups and the CoCo, is
responsible for reviewing the second draft of the release for balance
in credit for discovery and scientific accuracy, including specific
mention of scientists and institutions.  He or she will post the draft
to the collaboration via sdss-general, and will notify
the Chair of the SDSS Advisory Council and the Chair of the ARC Board
of Governors, for further comments; this posting must happen at least
one week before the release goes to the press.<br>
<br>

7) The SDSS PIO then sends the third draft of the release to the
Director, who formally approves the release if at this point there are no
objections.<br>
<br>

8) The final draft is then distributed to the updated list of authors by the
SDSS PIO.  Any changes at this point are made by the SDSS PIO with the
concurrence of the Spokesperson and the principal author.  The
release is then distributed publicly by the SDSS PIO.<br>
<br>

9) In some cases an institution may wish to formulate a version of the SDSS
release for local distribution.  In that case, the institutional PIO sends a
draft of that release to the Spokesperson, with a copy to the
SDSS PIO, allowing an opportunity for input from the SDSS.  The local
release must not precede the national release, and it will be requested that
the local release refer to the national release (e.g. as posted on
www.sdss.org). <br>
<br>

10) In the case of a non-national release requested by a collaboration
member (such as the findings of an undergraduate team) using
non-public SDSS data, the press release procedures still apply. The
PIO of the principal author's institution is invited to contribute.
Like SDSS participating scientists, students need to understand and
participate in the process of getting a press release to the
public. The release will be placed on the SDSS Web site.<br>
<br>


11) It must be understood by all parties that in order to meet the target
date for the release, all comments must be sent to the SDSS PIO in a timely
manner. <br>
