Procedures for Early Collaborative Use of SDSS Data with
Non-Participants

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="sdss_poo.html#secIV.A">Section IV.A</a> of the <a
href="sdss_poo.html">SDSS Principles of Operation (PoO)</a> states that
data rights are in the hands of scientists at an SDSS institution
("Participants") who have PI status or whose primary responsibility is
the construction of the SDSS, and of individuals at other institutions
granted such Participant status.  <a href="sdss_poo.html#secV.D">Section
V.D of the PoO</a> describes the principles under which SDSS data may be
used collaboratively by non-Participants prior to public release.  The
purpose of this document is to define efficient procedures for
implementing this section of the PoO.  The procedures are slightly
different for "inside" collaborators, who are at SDSS institutions, and
for "outside" collaborators, who are not.</p>

<p>Examples of the kinds of collaborations covered by this policy
include:
<ul>
<li>follow-up observations of interesting SDSS objects with larger
telescopes or at other wavelengths;

<li>use of SDSS data in generating observing proposals for space
observatories (e.g., AXAF), in collaboration with some non-SDSS
astronomers;

<li>searching the SDSS catalogues for objects with the color
signature of some particular type of object (e.g., T Tauri stars), in
collaboration with a non-SDSS scientist who has devised an efficient
search algorithm;

<li>comparison of the SDSS luminosity functions for galaxies with data
on faint galaxies observed at Keck;

<li>comparison of SDSS data to data from other surveys (e.g., 2MASS) in
a particular area of the sky;

<li>comparison of SDSS star counts with a new model for the Galaxy;
</ul>and so on.</p>

<h2>"Inside" Collaborations</h2>

<p>In practice, much of the scientific analysis of the SDSS data will be
done by students and postdocs at SDSS institutions.  These "inside"
collaborators access the data through individuals at their institution
with data rights.  These individuals (i.e., the graduate and
postdoctoral advisors) are responsible for ensuring that their
collaborators read and agree to the <a href="sdss_poo.html">PoO</a> and
<a href="pub_policy.html">publication policy</a>, and they are
responsible for ensuring that these policies are followed and that the
data are not released outside the collaboration. They and their
institutions are also responsible for providing the necessary research
support: computing, page charges, trips to scientific meetings, and so
forth.</p>

<p>Because collaborative work with students and postdocs will be the
norm rather than the exception, no special permission is required to
initiate such collaborations.  However, as with all SDSS investigations,
a team contact should provide notice to the collaboration upon the
initiation of any project that is expected to lead ultimately to a
publication, as described in <a href="sdss_poo.html#secIV.B">Section
IV.B.1 of the PoO</a> and <a href="pub_policy.html#sec8.1">Section 8.1
of the Publication Policy</a>.  Such notification is especially
important in the case of Ph.D. theses, so that those concerned are aware
of any potential conflicts with other projects.  The notification of
initiation of an investigation should be submitted by an individual with
data rights and should list all of the student, postdoctoral, and other
collaborators.  By submitting the notification, the individual with data
rights implicitly accepts responsibility for ensuring that SDSS policies
are followed by the non-Participants who are collaborating on the
project.</p>


<h2>"Outside" Collaborations</h2>

<p>Collaborations involving colleagues not at an SDSS institution,
including students and postdocs of Participants at non-SDSS institutions
and visitors at SDSS institutions, are treated a little differently.
These collaborators will again access the data through Participants with
data rights.  At the initiation of such collaborations, the SDSS
scientist(s) involved should:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li><p>Inform the non-SDSS scientist(s) of the SDSS rules and guidelines
(the PoO, the Publication Policy, and this Collaboration Policy) and
obtain his/her consent to abide by them.  In particular, non-SDSS
scientists should understand and agree that they may not disseminate the
SDSS data to which they have access in any way, and that publications
resulting from the collaboration will be subject to the Publication
Policy.</p>

<li><p>Obtain permission to proceed from the Collaboration Council
(CoCo).  In an e-mail message sent to <kbd>sdss-general</kbd> and cc'ed
to the chair of the CoCo (currently
<kbd>frieman@falstaff.fnal.gov</kbd>), the SDSS Participant(s) involved
should briefly describe the proposed project, list the names and
institutions of the proposed collaborators, and state their willingness
to ensure that the outside collaboration will proceed according to the
SDSS rules, policies and guidelines.  They should also indicate what
special resources or expertise the outside collaborators bring to the
project (e.g., telescope access, experience with specific analysis
techniques) and/or, in the case of students and postdocs, the connection
between the proposed collaboration and the Participant's overall SDSS
science efforts.</p>

<p>In the case of students and postdocs supervised by SDSS Participants,
permission can be expected in all cases where the collaboration is an
important part of the Participant's overall SDSS science efforts.  In
the case of other outside collaborators, permission can be expected in
all cases where the outside collaborators bring resources or expertise
that are not readily available within the SDSS collaboration itself.
Multiple collaborations pursuing similar ends are allowed, so the
establishment of one outside collaboration does not preclude another
along similar lines.</p>

<p>The CoCo chair has three weeks to respond if there are any objections
to the proposed collaboration, consulting with other CoCo members if
he/she deems it necessary.  If there is no response during this three
week period, permission may be assumed to be granted, and the project
and collaboration may proceed.</p>

<li><p>Post notice of the proposed project(s) to the Publication
Archive, as per usual.</p>

<li><p>Post papers resulting from such collaborations to the SDSS
collaboration and invite authorship, as for an "internal" SDSS paper,
and be sure the outside collaborators understand in advance that this
will take place.</p>
