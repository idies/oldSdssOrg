<p>The following are examples of spectra obtained by the SDSS twin
spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory.  The spectra below have been
processed by the SDSS 2D reduction software.  The vertical lines in the
spectra represent features identified by the SDSS 1D code.  Dotted green
lines correspond to either emission or absorption features fit by 1D.
Solid blue lines indicate the location of strong emission features
located by the code.  Solid red lines show potential emission features
that 1D failed to identify.  Dotted magenta lines give the location of
night sky lines.  The yellow curve shows a smooth continuum for the
spectrum while the lower green curve represents the error in the number
of counts.</p>
