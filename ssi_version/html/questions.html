<a name="logo"><strong>What does the SDSS logo represent?</strong></a>
<p><img src="logos/SDSS_pi_bevel.gif" alt="SDSS logo" width="130"
height="115" align="right">The Sloan Survey's goal is to image one-half
of the northern celestial hemisphere (one quarter of the total sky), as
well as a smaller portion of the southern sky.  The portion of the
universe that the survey will observe is represented by our vaguely
parachute-shaped logo.  We are at the center of the logo, at the vertex
of the parachute strings.  The elliptical background evokes the shape of
a galaxy, the celestial object of greatest interest to the Sloan
Survey.</p>
<p>Because the total solid angle (area) of the survey will be 10,000
square degrees, or pi steradians, the logo is sometimes jokingly
referred to as "pi on the sky".</p>

<a name="images"><strong>Can I download/use the images from the SDSS
site?</strong></a>
<p>Yes, with a few restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li> You must maintain the image credits if you publish or reproduce the
image for any purpose other than personal enjoyment.
<li> You must not use the image in such a way as to imply endorsement
for a product or service.
<li> If you reproduce these images on a web page, we ask that you
provide a link back to our site.
</ul>

<a name="visit"><strong>Can I visit Apache Point Observatory and see
the Sloan telescope?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Mike Mills)</em>
<p>You are welcome to visit <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu">APO</a>
during daytime hours.  However, there are presently no public tours.

<a name="sloan"><strong>Who is the "Sloan" in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey?</strong></a> 
<br>
<em>(DW Anderson)</em>
<p>The "Sloan" refers to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, one of the
major funding sources of the survey.  You can learn about Mr. Sloan and
his philanthropic foundation at <a
href="http://www.sloan.org">http://www.sloan.org</a>.  More information
about all the members of the survey is also available 
<a href="members/index.html">on our site</a>.</p>

<a name="satellites"><strong>How will the project be affected by the
Iridium constellation of satellites?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Mark Stubbs)</em>
<p>The problems of man-made satellites streaking across the images are
well-known to most astronomers.  The Iridium satellites may pose an
additional challenge: many observers have <a
href="http://www.satellite.eu.org/sat/vsohp/iridium.html">reported
"flares"</a> lasting several seconds, during which reflected sunlight
makes an Iridium satellite appear almost as bright as Venus!</p>
<p>In general, detecting and removing satellite tracks from the images
is a fairly easy process for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the satellites are orbiting very quickly, they will show up
as thin straight-line streaks across the entire CCD image.  This is a
very distinctive feature.
<li>The Iridium satellites, like many non-geostationary satellites, will
travel in polar orbits.  The Sloan mosaic camera has 30 CCDs, 5 filters
in an east-west direction, 6 CCDs wide in a north-south direction.  So a
typical polar satellite track will be seen in only one color, another
distinguishing characteristic.
<li>Satellite tracks in one image will not be present in overlapping
images taken at a different time.
</ul>
<p>Rich Kron, survey director, adds, "We've also looked into the
possibility of predicting the worst Iridium 'flares' and then ensuring
that we choose a scan that won't intersect it.  It is not yet clear if
it is worth the bother (the coincidence of a flare and our pointing
won't be that common), but we have thought about it!"</p>

<a name="pollution"><strong>Is light pollution a problem for the Sloan
Survey?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Robert MacDowell)</em>
<p>Bruce Gillespie, Site Operations Manager for Apache Point
Observatory, responds: "Light pollution is a big issue here, and
considerable time and effort are spent on it.  Lighting ordinances have
been enacted for Alamogordo and Cloudcroft, and we are working to get
the entire county, state, and federal installations (e.g. Holloman Air
Force Base) similarly cloaked.  The skies here are still pretty dark, so
the main concern is holding the line against sprawl (which is pretty
slow out here).  Enforcement of existing codes and educating the public
are also important elements of our efforts.  In order to work multiple
fronts, we employ the time and efforts of many of the local amateur
astronomers in lobbying and enforcement activities.  We are members of
the International Dark Sky Association and make good use of their advice
and educational materials."</p>

<a name="fl"><strong>Where in the sky are the first light photos
from?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Rich and Sue Renner)</em>
<p><a href="news/releases/19980608.fl.html#images">The images</a> were
taken in the region of the constellations Serpens and Ophiuchus (so
about 16h right ascension, and a declination of 0 degrees).</p>
<br>
<a name="dust"><strong>What is the density of interstellar
dust/gas?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Fred Dallas)</em>
<p>Throughout our galaxy there are clouds or regions of stuff which we
collectively call the interstellar medium (ISM).  It's made of gas
(atoms, ions, molecules) and dust (small grains of ices, metals,
silicates, carbon, etc.).  The standard lore (Mihalas and Binney,
<em>Galactic Astronomy</em>) divides gaseous regions into five basic
types:
<ul>
<li>cold, dense molecular gas (T = 20 Kelvins, number density &gt; 1000
particles per cubic centimeter): these clouds contain most of the mass
of the ISM, but occupy a very small relative volume because they're so
cold and dense.
<li>cold gas (T = 100 K, n = 20 per cc): these clouds of primarily
neutral atomic gas occupy about 3 times the volume of the colder clouds
above.
<li>hot neutral gas (T = 6000 K, n = 0.3 per cc): this gas surrounds the
colder clouds and occupies about one fifth of the total ISM volume.
<li>hot ionized gas (T = 8000 K, n &gt; 0.5 per cc): this gas surrounds hot
stars and consists mainly of ionized hydrogen (i.e. protons).
<li>very hot medium (T = 10<sup>6</sup> K, n = 0.001 per cc): this
medium, heated by shock waves from supernovae, occupies most of the
volume of the ISM.
</ul>

<a name="spectrogram"><strong>What is a spectrogram?</strong></a>
<br>
<em>(Victor Conley)</em>
<p>A <strong>spectrogram</strong> is literally a photograph of a
spectrum, but the term is also more loosely used to mean any
representation of a spectrum (such as a graph of light intensity versus
light frequency).  The device that produces a spectrogram is called a
<strong>spectrograph</strong>.  So for example, a simple prism is a
spectrograph.  It produces a spectrum by refracting (bending) different
frequencies of light by different amounts.  An ordinary compact disc is
another kind of spectrograph called a diffraction grating; the
closely-spaced ridges of the grating diffract different light
frequencies at different angles.  You could even say that a collection
of rain droplets in the atmosphere forms a spectrograph, because of the
rainbow they produce!</p>
<p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey uses a spectrograph that combines the
ideas of a diffraction grating and a prism into an instrument
appropriately named a "grism."  The SDSS spectrograph is designed so
that the light from hundreds of galaxies and quasars can be turned into
spectra at the same time.  The light travels from the telescope's focal
plane through optical fibers and then gets split into spectra by the
grism.  The hundreds of spectra are then photographed by a digital
camera.  For an example of this, you can look at images and graphs
showing the results of
