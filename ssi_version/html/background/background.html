<h2>Mapping the Universe</h2>
<p>Mapmaking, laying the gridwork for reality, is an activity central to
the step-by-step advance of human knowledge.  The last decade has seen
an explosion in the scale and diversity of the mapmaking enterprise,
with fields as disparate as genetics, oceanography, neuroscience, and
surface physics applying the power of computers to recording and
understanding enormous and complex new territories.  This ability to
record and digest immense quantities of data in a timely way is changing
the face of science.  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the most ambitious
astronomical survey project ever undertaken, will bring this modern
practice of comprehensive and quantitative mapping to cosmography, the
science of mapping the universe and determining our place in it.</p>
<p>The Sky Survey will systematically map one-quarter of the entire sky,
producing a detailed image of it and determining the positions and
absolute brightnesses of more than 100 million celestial objects.  It
will also measure the distance to a million of the nearest galaxies,
giving us a three-dimensional picture of the universe through a volume
one hundred times larger than that explored to date.  The Sky Survey
will also record the distances to 100,000 quasars, the most distant
objects known, giving us an unprecedented hint at the distribution of
matter to the edge of the visible universe.</p>
<p>The Sky Survey is the latest in an ancient and honorable tradition of
surveying the sky.  Many of humanity's earliest permanent records
describe the attempts to frame the universe.  The Sky Survey will
advance this tradition in a number of ways.  As the first large-area
survey to use electronic light detectors, the image it produces will be
substantially more sensitive and accurate than earlier surveys, which
relied on photographic techniques.  The results of the Sky Survey will
be available to the scientific community electronically, both as images
and as precise catalogs of all the objects discovered.  The Sky Survey
also represents a significant increase in scale.  The total quantity of
information produced, about 15 terabytes (trillion bytes), rivals the
information content of the Library of Congress.</p>
<p>By systematically and sensitively observing such a large fraction of
the sky, the Sky Survey will have a significant impact on astronomical
studies as diverse as the large-scale structure of the universe, the
origin and evolution of galaxies, the relation between dark and luminous
matter, the structure of our own Milky Way, and the properties and
distribution of the dust from which stars like our sun were created.  It
will represent a new reference point, a field guide to the universe at
the millenium, which will be used by scientists for decades to come.</p>
