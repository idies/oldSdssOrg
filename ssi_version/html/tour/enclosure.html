Here you see the 2.5-meter telescope in a horizontal position inside its
protective enclosure.  The telescope is exposed for its nightly survey
when the enclosure building wheels away.  This movable structure costs
less than a conventional dome.  The design also avoids the heating and
cooling problems that can distort observing from within a dome.
