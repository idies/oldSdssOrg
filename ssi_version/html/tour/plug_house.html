Astronomers will select 600 distant objects at a time for spectral
analysis.  In the support building, shown above, astronomers will plug
drilled aluminum discs with optical fiber cables to feed light from the
telescope to spectrographs.  When attached to the telescope, each cable
will be located at the celestial position of a selected object.

This aluminum plug plate, from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey,
illustrates what an SDSS plate will look like after it has been drilled
with holes.  For each hole, there's a corresponding object in the sky
waiting to have its spectrum observed.

Here's a view of a plug plate that's been drilled, fitted with optical
fibers, and mounted on the spectograph assembly.  This entire package
will be flipped upside down and mounted to the underside of the
2.5-meter telescope at its focal plane.
