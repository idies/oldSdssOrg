The White Sands National Monument is a huge field of white gympsum sand
dunes located near Alamogordo, New Mexico.  The goal of the National
Monument is to protect this unique ecosystem -- not only the dunes,
but also the plant and animal species that have adapted to this bizarre
and ever-changing landscape.

Here the full moon rises over the Sacramento Mountains that border the
White Sands to the east.  This Lincoln National Forest mountain range is
home to the Apache Point Observatory.
