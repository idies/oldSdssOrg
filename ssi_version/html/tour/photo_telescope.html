The domed building encloses the <a
href="../news/features/19981023.mt.html">0.5-meter Photometric
Telescope</a> used for monitoring subtle changes in the atmosphere
during the course of the survey.  Its principal function is to aid
astronomers in accurately calibrating an object's brightness, as
measured with the main telescope.  The other dome in the distance houses
the 1.0-meter NMSU remote observing telescope.

This telescope, like many others, rotates in declination (the "latitude"
direction) and right ascension (the "longitude" direction).
