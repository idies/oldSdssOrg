This instrument room is in some sense the heart of the telescope.  All
of the telescope communication cabling passes from this room through an
underground culvert to the <a href="plug_house.html">support
building</a>.  Also, almost all of the control electronics and
instrumentation are here.  For example, the computer equipment in the
foreground controls the positioning of the telescope.  Behind this
equipment is the "cone room" containing the massive central axis and
bearing of the telescope, on which the upper body of the telescope
rotates about the azimuth.
