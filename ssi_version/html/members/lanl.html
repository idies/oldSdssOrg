"We serve the nation by developing and applying the best science
and technology to make the world a better and safer place." <br>
- Los Alamos National Laboratory Vision Statement</br>
</div>
<p>
Los Alamos National Laboratory began in-kind contributions to the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey in early 1999 and became a formal member of
the collaboration in March of 2002. The Laboratory has been providing
infrastructure and operations services in the form of controls
engineering and observing support for the photometric telescope. Los
Alamos involvement in the SDSS is structured as an Astrophysics Survey
Team (AST) spanning multiple organizations within the Laboratory. The
AST is overseen by William H. Press, Deputy Director for Science and
Technology, who is an External Participant in the Survey.
</p>
<p>
Engineers at Los Alamos have been responsible for the monitoring of
telescope performance issues using a system based on the Experimental
Physics and Industrial Control System [EPICS] toolkit originally
co-developed by Los Alamos and Argonne National Laboratory. Los Alamos
scientists have also contributed to the establishment of the
photometric primary standard star network.
</p>
<p>
Astrophysical research activity at Los Alamos is diverse and spread
throughout the Laboratory with the Los Alamos Astrophysics
organization serving as a clearinghouse for information. Initial
studies specific to the SDSS include work in star formation, stellar
activity, brown dwarfs, the interstellar medium, and the creation of a
galaxy cluster radial velocity catalog.
</p>
<p>
Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of
California for the National Nuclear Security Administration, of the US
Department of Energy.
