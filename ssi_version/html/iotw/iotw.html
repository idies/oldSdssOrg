Located in the constellation of Pisces, at a red shift of
0.039, the spiral Galaxy NGC60 reveals large 
extended spiral arms extending much further out than as 
expected on the first glance.  The low surface
brightness of the spiral arms makes it difficult 
to detect them against the light of the sky background.
In order to reveal this structures six exposures in a individual
color band of the SDSS-2.5m telescope were added and 
thereby reducing the noise in the background. <br>
The striking kink located roughly 17 kpc away from the 
center of the galaxy is most probably a star burst triggered 
from gravitational interaction with a neighboring galaxy. 
With a scale length of the disk of approximately 14 kpc, the galaxy 
is nearly three times the spatial size as the Milky way.<br>
Also visible in the image are two asteroids 
in rainbow like colors moving close to the ecliptic.<br>
