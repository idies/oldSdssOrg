<question>
<para>What does the SDSS logo represent?</para>
<figure><title>The SDSS logo</title>
<graphic format="gif" fileref="logos/SDSS_pi_bevel.gif"/>
</figure>
</question>

<answer>
<para>The Sloan Survey's goal is to image one-half of the
northern celestial hemisphere (one quarter of the total sky), as well
as a smaller portion of the southern sky. The portion of the universe
that the survey will observe is represented by our vaguely
parachute-shaped logo. We are at the center of the logo, at the vertex
of the parachute strings. The elliptical background evokes the shape
of a galaxy, the celestial object of greatest interest to the Sloan
Survey.</para>
<para>Because the total solid angle (area) of the survey will be
10,000 square degrees, or pi steradians, the logo is sometimes
jokingly referred to as "pi on the sky".</para>

<question><para>Who is the "Sloan" in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey?</para></question>

<answer><para>The "Sloan" refers to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
one of the major funding sources of the survey. You can learn about
Mr. Sloan and his philanthropic foundation at <ulink
url="http://www.sloan.org">http://www.sloan.org</ulink>. More
information about all the members of the survey is also available on
<ulink url="http://www.sdss.org/members/index.html">our
site</ulink>.</para></answer>

<question>

<para>The <application>SDSS Query Analyzer</application> (SDSSQA) used
to work, but now it doesn't any more. How can I fix
it?</para></question>

<answer><para>In general, the use of <application>sdssQA</application>
is deprecated. The CasJobs interface: 
<ulink url="http://casjobs.sdss.org/CasJobs/">http://casjobs.sdss.org/CasJobs/</ulink>,
is a better tool for most purposes.</para>

<para>If you really want to use the SDSS QA, there are a few things
you can do. Begin by removing the existing installation. When you are
certain that no instances of <application>sdssQA</application> are
running, delete the <filename class="directory">.sdssQA</filename>
directory, probably found in your home directory. Then reinstall
<application>sdssQA</application> using the latest jar file from
<ulink url="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/help/download/sdssQA/default.asp">
the sdssQA page</ulink>.</para>

<question>
<para>How can I query for specific types of galaxies?</para></question>

<answer><para>You have several options, none of them perfectly
reliable. One of these the <property>eclass</property> field,
described in section 4.10.2.4 of the 
<ulink url="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123..485S">early data release paper</ulink>
and in the 
<ulink url="http://www.sdss.org/dr3/algorithms/redshift_type.html">algorithms section of the data release pages.</ulink>.
