<section><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DocBook">DocBook</ulink> is
an XML markup language designed for writing technical documentation,
and is used by many projects, including the Linux Documentation
Project, the documentation of the Linux kernel itself, GNOME, and
KDE. It is particularly nice in that it can be easily converted into
anything from html to pdf to the MS Word RTF format.</para>

<para>Automated building of the web site is done through
<ulink url="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</ulink>, which is most popular
in the java world but can be used for other systems (such as web
sites) as well.

<section><title>Using ant to build DocBook</title>

<para>Several utilities can be used to convert DocBook to html, and
two different systems are included in most modern Linux distributions.
One of them, supplied by the
<systemitem>docbook-style-xsl</systemitem>
<application>rpm</application> package in Fermi Linux, is simply a
collection of style sheets, and the build can be implemented in ant
with a <filename>build.xml</filename> file that looks like
this:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project name="sdssorg" default="html" basedir=".">

<property name="stylesheetHome"
          value="/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.61.2-2"/>

<target name="html">
    <style basedir="docsrc" 
           destdir="doc/html"
           style="${stylesheetHome}/html/docbook.xsl">
	<include name="maintenance.xml"/>
	<include name="faq.xml"/>
    </style>
</target>

</project>
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>Unfortunately, the default xslt processor in my ant in very slow,
and sometimes fails altogether. <application>xsltproc</application> is
much faster, and always seems to work on valid files.</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project name="sdssorg" default="html" basedir=".">
<property name="stylesheetHome"
          value="/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.61.2-2"/>

<target name="xhtml">
    <mkdir dir="doc/xhtml"/>
    <!-- It is possible to use the ant "style" task, but whatever processor
         my version of ant uses sometimes fails, and in much slower than
	 xsltproc even when it succeeds. -->
    <apply executable="xsltproc" dest="doc/xhtml" parallel="false">
        <arg value="--output"/>
	<targetfile/>
        <arg value="${stylesheetHome}/xhtml/docbook.xsl"/>
	<srcfile/>
	<fileset dir="./docsrc" includes="*.xml"/>
	<mapper type="glob" from="*.xml" to="*.html"/>
    </apply>
</target>
]]></programlisting>

<para>There is yet another method, supplied by the
<systemitem>docbook-utils</systemitem>
<application>rpm</application> package in Fermi Linux, has prettier results. The
corresponding <filename>build.xml</filename> file looks like this:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<project name="sdssorg" default="html" basedir=".">

<target name="html" depends="prepare">
    <mkdir dir="doc/html"/>
    <apply executable="docbook2html">
        <arg line="--nochunks"/>
	<arg line="--output doc/html"/>
	<fileset dir="./docsrc" includes="*.xml"/>
    </apply>
</target>

</project>
]]>
</programlisting>

<para>For ant to build this properly, the Sun Java must
be used.</para>
